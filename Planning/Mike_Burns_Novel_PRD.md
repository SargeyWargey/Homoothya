# The Life of Mike Burns (Hoomothya): Historical Fiction Novel - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision Statement
Create a compelling, emotionally resonant historical fiction novel chronicling the extraordinary life of Mike Burns (Hoomothya), from his childhood among the Kwevkepaya Yavapai people through the trauma of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his complex journey through American military and educational institutions, and his later years as a voice for his people. The novel will honor the truth of his experiences while crafting a narrative that engages modern readers with the human cost of westward expansion and cultural genocide.

### 1.2 Project Goals
- **Emotional Power**: Create a deeply moving story that makes readers *feel* Burns's journey—the joy of childhood, the horror of loss, the complexity of survival, the dignity of witness. This is a novel first, not a history lesson.
- **Literary Excellence**: Produce gripping, immersive prose with vivid scenes, complex characters, and narrative tension that keeps readers turning pages. Research serves the story; it doesn't drive it.
- **Character Truth**: Present Mike Burns and the Yavapai people as fully realized human beings with interior lives, contradictions, desires, and agency—not as historical figures or cultural representatives.
- **Cultural Respect**: Honor Yavapai culture through authentic, specific details woven naturally into scenes (not explained like a textbook), with mandatory consultation and sensitivity review.
- **Historical Grounding**: Root dramatic scenes in documented events and primary sources, particularly Mike Burns's own testimony, while using novelist's tools to bring history alive.

### 1.3 Target Specifications
- **Page Count**: 350 pages
- **Word Count**: ~87,500 words (based on standard 250 words/page)
- **Format**: Literary historical fiction novel
- **Target Audience**: Adult readers interested in American history, Native American experiences, historical fiction, and stories of survival and resilience
- **Reading Level**: Literary adult fiction
- **Tone**: Serious, emotionally powerful, respectful, authentic

### 1.4 Success Metrics

**Primary (Literary Impact):**
- Beta readers report they "couldn't put it down"—narrative tension works
- Readers form genuine emotional connection with Mike and other characters
- Scenes feel immediate and visceral—readers are transported, not lectured to
- Voice feels authentic and intimate—first-person POV creates closeness
- Story reveals character through action/dialogue/thought, not exposition

**Secondary (Historical & Cultural Integrity):**
- Historical accuracy validated by subject matter experts
- Cultural portrayal approved by Yavapai consultants and sensitivity readers
- Yavapai people shown as complex individuals, not stereotypes
- Research woven invisibly into dramatic scenes
- Balanced use of dramatic license that enhances rather than distorts historical truth

**Ultimate Test:** Could someone with no knowledge of Mike Burns read this novel, be completely absorbed in the story, and come away both moved and educated—without ever feeling like they were being taught?

## 2. Research Plan: Mining for Story Gold

**Research Philosophy**: Don't gather facts to report them—mine for the sensory details, emotional truths, and human moments that bring scenes alive. Every research session should yield not just information, but story material: the smell of mesquite smoke, the weight of a word unspoken, the texture of fear.

**The Goal**: Research disappears into the story. Readers shouldn't see the scaffolding—they should just experience Mike's world as if they're living it.

### 3.2 Narrative Structure Elements

**Point of View**:
- **Primary POV**: First-person from Mike Burns's perspective (allows intimate access to his thoughts and emotions)
- **Rationale**: First-person honors Burns's own autobiographical writings and creates intimate connection with reader

**Framing Device** (ADOPTED):
- **Opening**: Elderly Mike Burns (age 69) at Fort McDowell in 1934, beginning to write his manuscript
- **Structure**: Flash back to childhood and proceed chronologically through his life
- **Interludes**: Periodic returns to the writing present (1930s), showing him wrestling with memory, confronting trauma, making decisions about what to include
- **Closing**: Return to 1934 for his final days and death (November 26, 1934)
- **Epilogue**: Brief flash-forward revealing the manuscript's eventual publication in 2010/2012, vindicating his witness

**Framing Device Benefits**:
- Creates immediate narrative tension: elderly man racing against time to tell his story
- Allows meta-commentary on memory, witnessing, and the act of writing history
- Provides emotional bookends: begin and end with Mike as agent of his own story
- Honors the historical fact that Burns DID write his autobiography
- Gives readers hope even in darkest moments: we know he survived to bear witness
- Creates powerful irony: he writes not knowing his story will eventually be published

**Chapter Structure**:
- **Prologue**: Fort McDowell, 1934 - Mike begins writing (~5-7 pages)
- **Act I (Chapters 1-12)**: Childhood through massacre (~29,000 words)
- **Act II (Chapters 13-24)**: Transformation, education, military service (~29,000 words)
- **Act III (Chapters 25-34)**: Return, witnessing, legacy (~27,000 words)
- **Epilogue**: 1934 death scene + brief flash-forward to publication (~5-7 pages)
- **Total**: Prologue + 34 chapters + Epilogue = ~87,500 words

**Framing Device Integration**:
- **Prologue**: Full scene of elderly Mike in 1934 beginning to write
- **Interlude Chapters** (4-6 brief returns to 1934 scattered throughout):
  - After massacre (wrestling with whether to describe the horror)
  - During Carlisle section (reflecting on cultural loss)
  - During scout service (confronting moral compromises)
  - Before final act (considering whether anyone will read this)
- **Epilogue**: Return to 1934, his death, then flash-forward to 2010/2012 publication

**Pacing Strategy**:
- **Act I**: Slower, immersive pacing to establish Yavapai world before accelerating toward massacre
- **Act II**: Variable pacing reflecting institutional rhythms and military campaigns
- **Act III**: Contemplative pacing with bursts of action around key moments

### 3.3 Temporal Structure

**Timeline Approach**:
- Generally chronological progression
- Occasional flashbacks during later acts to childhood memories
- Flash-forwards in framing device (if used)
- Time skips clearly marked, especially in Act II which covers 36 years

**Time Compression**:
- **Act I**: Relatively compressed (7-8 years) but feels expansive through detail
- **Act II**: Selective scenes from 36 years, connected by brief transitional passages
- **Act III**: More detailed coverage of later years when Burns is consciously witnessing

- **Historical vs. Fictional Elements**: What's documented vs. imagined

### 6.3 Writing Phase (Weeks 14-40)

**Writing Schedule**:
- **Target**: 1 chapter per week (2,500 words)
- **Act I**: 12 weeks (Chapters 1-12)
- **Act II**: 12 weeks (Chapters 13-24)
- **Act III**: 11 weeks (Chapters 25-35)
- **Total**: 35 weeks with buffer weeks

**Daily Writing Goals**:
- Consistent daily writing: 500-700 words/day, 5 days/week
- Reserve 2 days for research, revision, and consultation

**Writing Process** (Scene-First Approach):
1. Review chapter outline and **visualize the scene**—where are we? who's here? what's the emotional core?
2. **Write the draft living in the moment**—be Mike, don't describe him. Show don't tell.
3. Trust the first draft—get the emotional truth down, even if rough
4. **Immediate scene check**: Does this scene:
   - Start with action/dialogue/sensory detail (not exposition)?
   - Show character through behavior/speech/thought?
   - Create tension or emotional stakes?
   - Reveal something new about character or situation?
   - End pulling reader forward?
5. Set aside minimum 48 hours
6. **Revision pass for craft**:
   - Strengthen sensory details (what do we smell/taste/hear/feel?)
   - Cut exposition; show through action
   - Sharpen dialogue; add subtext
   - Vary sentence rhythm; build pacing
   - Deepen emotional beats
7. **Fact-check and cultural verify** specific details (not whole scene)
8. Move to next chapter

**Quality Controls** (Craft-Focused):
- **Scene checklist**: Every scene must advance plot OR develop character OR both
- **Voice check**: Does this sound like Mike? Is it immediate, not historical?
- **Emotion check**: Are readers feeling this, or just reading about it?
- **Show/Tell ratio**: Cut 90% of telling; show through specific details
- Flag research questions separately—don't let them interrupt story flow

### 6.4 Revision Phase (Weeks 41-52)

**First Complete Revision** (Weeks 41-46):
- Read entire manuscript start to finish
- Focus on:
  - Story arc coherence
  - Character consistency
  - Pacing and structure
  - Thematic development
  - Historical accuracy
  - Cultural sensitivity

**Expert Review** (Weeks 47-48):
- Submit to historical consultant for accuracy review
- Submit to Yavapai cultural consultant for sensitivity review
- Submit to sensitivity readers from Native communities
- Incorporate feedback respectfully and thoroughly

**Second Revision** (Weeks 49-50):
- Line-by-line edit for prose quality
- Strengthen weak scenes
- Cut or condense where necessary to maintain pacing
- Enhance sensory details and emotional resonance
- Polish dialogue and voice

**Final Polish** (Weeks 51-52):
- Proofread for grammar, spelling, consistency
- Verify all historical facts and citations
- Final cultural sensitivity review
- Prepare author's note on historical accuracy and sources
- Format manuscript to specifications

### 6.5 Consultation Checkpoints

**Cultural Consultation Points**:
- **Pre-Writing**: Outline review by Yavapai cultural expert
- **Act I Completion**: Review of Yavapai cultural elements
- **Act II Completion**: Review of assimilation and identity themes
- **Full Manuscript**: Complete cultural sensitivity review
- **Final**: Review of author's note and acknowledgments

**Historical Consultation Points**:
- **Pre-Writing**: Verify timeline and major events
- **During Writing**: Ongoing fact-checking as questions arise
- **Full Manuscript**: Comprehensive historical accuracy review
- **Final**: Review of citations and historical note

### 6.6 Feedback Integration Protocol

**Receiving Feedback**:
- Listen/read feedback without immediate defensiveness
- Take time to understand the concern before responding
- Prioritize feedback from cultural consultants and sensitivity readers
- Distinguish between "must change" and "consider changing"

**Incorporating Feedback**:
- Cultural concerns = immediate priority for revision
- Historical accuracy concerns = research and verify
- Craft/style concerns = evaluate against story goals
- Document all major changes and reasons

**When to Hold Firm**:
- Only when cultural consultants agree approach is respectful
- When historical record clearly supports your interpretation
- When story integrity requires specific choice (but explain in author's note)

## 7. Historical Accuracy & Dramatic License Guidelines

### 7.1 Principles for Historical Fidelity

**Non-Negotiable Historical Facts** (NEVER alter):
- Documented dates of major events (Skeleton Cave Massacre, Carlisle enrollment, etc.)
- Documented casualties and participants in historical events
- Mike Burns's own testimony and writings
- Verifiable biographical details of real historical figures
- Cultural practices documented by ethnographers and tribal historians
- Geographic and environmental facts

**Flexible Historical Elements** (Can be interpreted):
- Exact dialogue (no one recorded what was actually said)
- Internal thoughts and motivations of real people
- Minor details of undocumented scenes
- Sequence of events within a general timeframe if not specifically documented
- Emotional reactions and psychological states

**Creative License Zones** (Where invention is necessary):
- Dialogue throughout (based on historical patterns of speech)
- Specific details of daily life not documented in sources
- Interior emotional experiences and thoughts
- Minor characters who are composites or fully fictional
- Connective scenes between documented events

### 7.2 Embellishment Guidelines

**When Dramatic Enhancement is Appropriate**:
- To create emotional resonance with documented events
- To make abstract historical concepts concrete for readers
- To fill gaps in the historical record with plausible scenarios
- To create narrative tension and pacing
- To develop character psychology consistent with documented actions

**When Dramatic Enhancement is NOT Appropriate**:
- Changing documented facts to create "better" story
- Inventing atrocities or horrors beyond what is documented
- Romanticizing or sanitizing real violence and trauma
- Creating fictional romantic plots that distort historical reality
- Altering cultural practices for dramatic effect

**Examples of Appropriate Embellishment**:
- Creating specific dialogue for the moment when young Hoomothya is captured, based on documented fact of his capture on December 22, 1872
- Imagining sensory details of the massacre (sounds, smells, sights) to make the horror visceral
- Creating specific teaching moments between Captain Burns and young Mike to show the assimilation process
- Inventing specific classroom scenes at Carlisle based on documented curriculum and practices
- Creating emotional conversations between Mike and fellow scouts about their moral position

**Examples of Inappropriate Embellishment**:
- Changing the date or death toll of Skeleton Cave Massacre
- Inventing a romantic relationship that didn't exist
- Creating a fictional heroic act by Mike that would change historical understanding
- Inventing positive aspects of Carlisle that contradict documented evidence
- Adding mystical or supernatural elements not part of Yavapai tradition

### 7.3 Handling Gaps in the Historical Record

**The March of Tears (1875)**:
- Mike was with Captain Burns, not with the Yavapai during their forced relocation
- **Solution**: Could include his learning about it later, feelings of guilt for not being there
- Could include meeting survivors and hearing their stories
- Brief scene of him learning what happened, imagining what they endured

**Years Between Major Events**:
- Many years (especially 1888-1908) are sparsely documented
- **Solution**: Select representative moments that show character development
- Use transitional passages to bridge time gaps
- Focus on emotional/psychological journey rather than complete biographical coverage

**Family Members' Names and Personalities**:
- Many of Mike's family members are not individually documented
- **Solution**: Consult with Yavapai Nation on appropriate naming practices
- Base characterizations on documented Yavapai cultural patterns
- Create full humans, not symbolic figures

**Specific Dialogue**:
- No conversations are documented verbatim
- **Solution**: Base dialogue on:
  - Mike Burns's own writing style
  - Documented speech patterns from the period
  - Cultural patterns of communication
  - Character voice consistency

### 7.4 Author's Note Requirements

**Transparency with Readers**:
- Include comprehensive author's note explaining research sources
- Acknowledge where dramatic license has been taken
- Direct readers to Mike Burns's own autobiographies
- Explain decision-making process for major creative choices
- Provide bibliography for readers who want to learn more

**Topics to Address**:
- Primary sources consulted (especially Burns's own writings)
- Consultation with Yavapai Nation and other experts
- Which characters are historical vs. fictional/composite
- Major events that are documented vs. imagined
- Cultural practices shown and their sources
- Acknowledgment of what cannot be known and choices made in unknowing

### 7.5 Fact-Checking Process

**During Writing**:
- Mark any fact that seems uncertain with [CHECK] tag
- Maintain running list of research questions
- Stop to verify facts that are central to scene's credibility
- Flag areas where multiple sources conflict

**During Revision**:
- Verify every specific date, name, and number
- Cross-reference major events with multiple sources
- Check cultural details with consultants
- Ensure consistency in details across chapters

**Citation System**:
- Maintain detailed footnotes/endnotes for own reference
- Decide whether to include footnotes in published version (may break immersion)
- Alternative: Include detailed source notes in author's note
- Provide bibliography

## 12. Risk Management

### 12.1 Potential Challenges

**Challenge 1: Cultural Sensitivity Concerns**
- **Risk**: Inadvertently perpetuating stereotypes or misrepresenting Yavapai culture
- **Mitigation**: Early and ongoing consultation with Yavapai cultural experts, multiple sensitivity readers, willingness to make major changes based on feedback
- **Contingency**: If consultants identify major problems, be prepared for significant rewrites

**Challenge 2: Research Gaps**
- **Risk**: Insufficient information about certain periods or events in Burns's life
- **Mitigation**: Thorough research phase before writing, maintaining research database, flagging gaps early
- **Contingency**: Focus on emotional truth and plausible scenarios when facts unavailable, clearly note in author's note what is documented vs. imagined

**Challenge 3: Emotional Difficulty of Material**
- **Risk**: Writing about genocide and trauma may be emotionally taxing
- **Mitigation**: Pace work appropriately, take breaks as needed, maintain perspective
- **Contingency**: Seek support if needed, adjust timeline if necessary

**Challenge 4: Timeline Slippage**
- **Risk**: Project takes longer than 60 weeks
- **Mitigation**: Build buffer into schedule, maintain consistent writing routine, track progress weekly
- **Contingency**: Adjust timeline while maintaining quality standards

**Challenge 5: Length Management**
- **Risk**: Manuscript significantly over or under target word count
- **Mitigation**: Monitor chapter lengths during writing, adjust outline if patterns emerge
- **Contingency**: Substantial editing process during revision phase

### 12.2 Ethical Considerations

**Question**: Do I have the right to tell this story?
- **Consideration**: Mike Burns wrote his own story; this novel is based on his testimony
- **Approach**: Honor Burns's voice, center his perspective, acknowledge this is interpretation of his testimony
- **Safeguard**: Extensive consultation with Yavapai community, willingness to step back if told this story should not be told by outsider

**Question**: How do I portray trauma without exploitation?
- **Consideration**: Skeleton Cave Massacre must be shown but not sensationalized
- **Approach**: Restraint, focus on emotional impact rather than graphic detail, honor the victims
- **Safeguard**: Sensitivity reader feedback, cultural consultant guidance

**Question**: How do I handle the complexity of Captain Burns?
- **Consideration**: He destroyed Burns's family and adopted him - morally complex
- **Approach**: Show complexity without excusing violence, no easy answers
- **Safeguard**: Avoid redemption narrative for Captain Burns, keep focus on Mike's experience
