# Master Scene Plan: Mike Burns Novel

**Purpose**: Complete scene-by-chapter breakdown with research needs, documentation status, and emotional architecture

**Organization**: Following three-act structure with 35 chapters + Prologue + Epilogue

**Word Count Target**: ~87,500 words (avg. 2,500 words/chapter)

---

## CRITICAL NARRATIVE DEVICE: IDENTITY REVEAL STRUCTURE

**Key Decision**: The name "Hoomothya" is NOT revealed in the Prologue. Readers meet Mike Burns but don't initially know about his Yavapai name.

**Narrative Strategy**:
- **Prologue**: Mike Burns (1934) refers to "a boy" who "had another name, a Yavapai name" - creating mystery
- **Act I (Chapters 1-12)**: Told from perspective of young Hoomothya - readers may not immediately connect this is Mike
- **Identity Reveal** (Chapter 12 or 13): The moment when readers realize Hoomothya IS Mike Burns - the renaming scene
- **Effect**: Readers experience the identity split/erasure viscerally by discovering the two names belong to one person

**Writing Implication**: Prologue avoids explicit statements like "I was called Hoomothya" - maintains distance and mystery about the boy's original name until the proper reveal moment in the narrative.

**Purpose**: Honors the violence of forced renaming by making readers feel the disconnect, then the painful connection.
