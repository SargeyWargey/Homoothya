# CHAPTER 1: LEARNING TO BE AMERICAN

**1873-1874**
**Arizona Territory**

They called me Mickie.

Not the name my mother gave me. Not the name I whispered to myself at night when no one could hear. Just Mickie. Lieutenant Thomas said it with a laugh: "Mickie would be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona!" The soldiers thought this was funny. I did not understand the joke. I was seven years old and I had learned not to ask questions.

Captain Burns's wife, Annie, taught me to say my new name properly. "Mickie Burns," she would repeat, patient and kind, her hand on my shoulder. "Can you say it, dear?"

I could say it. I could say many things in English by then. I learned quickly because my life depended on it. But saying the name felt like swallowing stones.

The Burns house at Fort Whipple had wooden floors that creaked under my feet. I had never walked on wooden floors before. Everything in that house was strange and hard—the chairs, the plates, the stiff clothes Annie made me wear. She was gentle when she dressed me in the mornings, buttoning the shirt up to my throat, pulling the suspenders over my shoulders. The fabric scratched. I wanted to tear it off and feel the sun on my skin, but I stood still and let her fuss over me.

"There," she would say, stepping back to look at me. "Don't you look handsome?"

I did not know what handsome meant. I knew I looked wrong.

Captain Burns treated me as if I were his own child. That is what people said, and it was true in a way that made my stomach hurt. He ruffled my hair when he passed me. He brought me sweets from the sutler's store. He taught me to ride his daughter Katie's pony, his big hands steadying me in the saddle. "Good lad," he would say. "You're a natural horseman."

At night, I slept on a cot in the corner of the kitchen. The house was too quiet. I was used to the sound of breathing all around me, the rustle of bodies shifting in sleep, the pop of embers in a fire. Here there was only silence and the tick of the clock on the mantle. Sometimes I lay awake and tried to remember other sounds. Voices speaking in—

I stopped myself. I had learned not to think about before.

But sometimes, alone in the dark kitchen, I whispered words in another language. Just to hear them. Just to know they were still there, inside me, waiting.

---

Annie Burns taught me to use a fork and knife. She taught me to say "please" and "thank you" and "yes, ma'am." She taught me that I must wash my hands before every meal and my face every morning. She taught me that good Christian boys went to church on Sunday and sat still during the sermon.

I learned all of these things. I was good at learning.

What I could not learn was how to forget.

Captain Burns came home one evening in early spring, his face flushed with whiskey and satisfaction. He swept Katie up in his arms and kissed Annie on the cheek, and then he turned to me.

"Mickie, my boy," he said. "How would you like to go to Ireland?"

I did not know what Ireland was.

"My father's homeland," he explained, crouching down so we were eye to eye. His breath smelled of tobacco and something sweet. "Green hills and cold rain and the finest people God ever made. I'm going to take you there someday. You'll meet my parents. They'll love you just as I do."

Annie smiled from the doorway. Katie clapped her hands. The captain's eyes were warm and kind, and I understood that I was supposed to feel something—gratitude, maybe, or happiness. I tried to arrange my face into the right expression.

"Thank you, sir," I said.

He laughed and ruffed my hair again. "Good lad."

That night, lying on my cot, I thought about green hills I would never see. I thought about a homeland that was not mine. I thought about parents who were not—

I stopped myself again.

I was getting good at stopping myself.

---

The days blurred together. Morning: Annie dressed me, fed me cornmeal mush and bacon. Afternoon: I did small chores around the house, carried water, swept the porch, helped Katie with her toys. Evening: Captain Burns came home, and we ate supper together like a family. Night: I lay on my cot and whispered words I was not supposed to remember.

I was learning to be American. That is what the captain said. "You're learning to be a proper American boy, Mickie. Isn't that fine?"

Yes, sir. That's fine, sir.

There were other children at Fort Whipple—officers' children, mostly, though a few enlisted men had brought their families west. They did not play with me. I was the Indian boy who lived with Captain Burns. I was a curiosity, something to stare at but not touch.

Katie was kind to me in her way. She was younger than I was, maybe four or five, with yellow curls and a laugh that sounded like bells. She would bring me her dolls and ask me to play house with her. I did not understand the game, but I learned to make the doll sit in the tiny chair and pretend to drink from the tiny cup.

"You're very good at this," Katie told me once, solemn and serious. "Mama says you're learning."

Yes, I wanted to say. I am learning to be someone else.

But I only nodded and moved the doll to the tiny bed.

---

Lieutenant Thomas came to visit one afternoon in summer. I remembered him—he was the one who had named me, who had laughed about the Irish Indian. He shook Captain Burns's hand and bent down to look at me.

"Well, Mickie," he said. "You've grown. And look at you in those clothes! A regular little gentleman."

I stood still and let him examine me. I had learned to do this too—to be looked at without flinching.

"He's a smart one," Captain Burns said, his hand on my shoulder. "Picks up English faster than you'd believe. Already knows his numbers and letters. Annie's been teaching him."

"Is that so?" Lieutenant Thomas smiled at me. "Can you read, Mickie?"

"A little, sir," I said. This was true. Annie had a primer she used with Katie, and she let me look at it in the evenings. I liked the way the letters made sense once you learned their sounds. I liked that reading was something I could control.

"Remarkable," Thomas said. "Simply remarkable. You've done well with him, Burns."

They talked about me as if I were not there. I was used to this. I let their words wash over me and thought about other things. The way the light slanted through the window. The smell of bread baking in the kitchen. The ache in my chest that never quite went away.

---

In the fall, Captain Burns died.

He left Fort Whipple on patrol and never came back. They said it was fever. They said he went quickly, calling for Annie and Katie at the end. No one told me if he called for me.

Annie wept for days. Katie clung to her mother's skirts and cried. The house filled with other officers' wives bringing food and sympathy, their voices low and sad.

I stood in the corner and did not know what to feel.

This man had taken me in. He had fed me, clothed me, treated me as his own child. He had promised to take me to Ireland to meet his parents. He had been kind to me in ways I could not deny.

He had also—

I stopped myself. I had gotten very good at stopping myself.

At the funeral, I stood beside Annie and Katie in my stiff church clothes. The chaplain spoke about Captain Burns's bravery and service and Christian virtue. The other officers looked solemn and respectful. Someone fired rifles into the air, and I flinched at the sound.

Annie reached down and took my hand. Hers was small and cold, trembling. I held it because that was what I was supposed to do.

"He loved you," she whispered to me, her voice thick with tears. "He loved you like his own son."

I know, I wanted to say. That's what makes it terrible.

But I only nodded and squeezed her hand and watched them lower the coffin into the ground.

---

After the funeral, there was the question of what to do with me.

I heard the officers' wives discussing it in low voices. "Poor Annie can't take care of him now, not with everything else." "Perhaps the boy should go back to his people." "Does he have people?" "Someone must know where he came from."

I sat on the porch steps and listened and said nothing. I had learned that the best way to survive was to be quiet and wait.

Lieutenant Bishop came to the house three days after the funeral. He was younger than Captain Burns, with a straight back and serious eyes. He sat with Annie in the parlor while I stood in the hallway, not quite hidden.

"I'll take the boy," I heard him say. "Burns was a friend. I owe him this much."

"Are you certain?" Annie's voice wavered. "He's a good child, but he's—"

"I'm certain," Bishop said. "I'll take care of him."

So it was decided. Annie packed my few belongings in a canvas bag—two shirts, one pair of trousers, the primer she had taught me to read from. She kissed my forehead and told me to be good. Katie gave me one of her wooden toys, a little horse she said was her favorite.

"So you won't forget us," she said.

I took the horse and put it in my bag and climbed into the wagon beside Lieutenant Bishop.

As we rode away from Fort Whipple, I looked back once. Annie and Katie stood in the doorway, waving. The house looked small and far away already, like something from a dream.

I turned forward and did not look back again.

---

Lieutenant Bishop's quarters were different from the Burns house. Smaller. Less decoration. He was not married, so there was no wife to fuss over me, no daughter to play games with. Just the two of us and his striker, a private named Webb who cooked and cleaned and mostly ignored me.

"You'll sleep here," Bishop told me, pointing to a bedroll in the corner. "You'll keep yourself clean and stay out of trouble. You'll help Private Webb with chores when he asks. And you'll keep up with your reading. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

He studied me for a long moment. His eyes were not unkind, but they were serious in a way that Captain Burns's had never been. "I'm not going to lie to you, boy. I don't know the first thing about raising a child. But I gave my word to Burns, and I keep my word. So we'll figure it out as we go. Fair enough?"

I nodded.

"Good." He turned away, then paused. "What do you want to be called? Mickie? Mike?"

The question startled me. No one had asked me what I wanted before.

"Mike," I heard myself say. It felt less like a child's name. Less like a pet.

"Mike it is, then."

That night, I lay on the bedroll and held Katie's wooden horse in my hands. I thought about Captain Burns in the ground at Fort Whipple. I thought about Annie's tears and Katie's small face. I thought about Lieutenant Bishop's serious eyes and his promise to a dead man.

I thought about all the things I was learning to be: Mickie. Mike. American. Good. Quiet. Grateful.

And alone in the dark, I whispered the name I was not supposed to remember anymore. The one my mother gave me. The one that meant I had belonged to people who were—

I stopped myself.

I closed my eyes and held the wooden horse and tried to sleep.

---

The months passed. I learned Lieutenant Bishop's routines and expectations. I learned that he was fair but stern, that he meant what he said, that he did not tolerate lies or laziness. I learned that he went quiet when he drank in the evenings, staring at the wall with a look I did not understand. I learned to make myself small and useful and unobtrusive.

I also learned that there were two people living inside me.

One was Mike Burns, the Indian boy who lived with the soldiers, who learned his letters and said "yes, sir" and wore scratchy clothes without complaining. Mike Burns was good at surviving. He knew how to be quiet, how to watch and learn, how to become what other people needed him to be.

The other was someone I could not name. Someone who remembered things Mike Burns was supposed to forget. Someone who woke in the night with his heart pounding and the taste of smoke in his mouth. Someone who heard voices speaking in a language that caught in his throat like grief.

I kept that second person buried deep. I fed Mike Burns and starved the other one and told myself this was how it had to be.

But sometimes, when I was alone, I felt him there—waiting, watching, remembering everything I was trying so hard to forget.

I did not know then that he would wait sixty years for me to tell his story.

I did not know that I owed him a debt I could never repay.

I only knew that I was learning to be American, and that learning meant forgetting, and that forgetting was just another kind of dying.

I was eight years old, and I was already a ghost.
