# PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS (1934)

**Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona**
**May 1934**

The mesquite outside my window looks the same as it did when I was a boy. Same gray-green leaves catching the early light. Same crooked branches reaching toward the Verde River. The land remembers what I remember, even when no one else does.

I am sixty-nine years old. My hands shake when I hold a pencil now, and the words don't come as easily as they once did. But the stories are still there, pressing against my ribs like stones. They have waited a long time. They can wait a little longer while I find the right words.

On the table before me: blank pages. A pencil worn smooth from use. My manuscript, the one I've been writing and rewriting for twenty-four years. The one no one will publish.

Outside, I hear the morning sounds of Fort McDowell. Children laughing in Yavapai and English. Women grinding corn. The shuffle of feet on packed earth. My people. Not all my people—those are gone—but the ones who remain. The ones who remember.

I am the only one living to tell what happened.

That sentence has lived in my mind for sixty-two years. It wakes me at night. It follows me through my days chopping wood, tending to my family, living this life that should not have been mine. I am the only one living to tell what happened on December 28, 1872, in a cave on the Salt River. I am the only one who can speak for the 225 people who died there—my father, my grandfather, my little brother, my baby sister, my aunt with her five children. All of them.

The white people say 76 died. They are wrong. I was there. I counted the bodies in my dreams for sixty-two years.

This morning, sitting at this table in my small house at Fort McDowell, I know what I must do. I have told my own story—Mike Burns's story, the servant boy, the Army scout, the man who learned to read and write in the white man's schools. I have written that manuscript and revised it and sent it to editors who say it is "interesting" but not "quite right for publication."

But there is another story I must tell. The story of a boy named Hoomothya. Wet Nose, they called him, because he was always curious, always sniffing around like a young coyote. That boy knew things I have forgotten. He lived in a world I can barely remember. He spoke a language that catches in my throat now, after all these years of English.

I owe that boy his story.

After Chehata's family taught me our ways again—the old words, the old songs, the names of places the white people don't know—I began to understand what I had lost. They shared the stories of our people: how we lived before the soldiers came, how we moved with the seasons, what the land meant to us. Her grandmother remembered things my own grandmother would have told me, if she hadn't died in that cave. Her mother taught me songs my own mother would have sung, if the soldiers hadn't killed her when I was five.

These are the stories I must preserve. Not just my story. Not just the massacre. But the life we lived before. The world that was whole. The people who were my people.

I know I am dying. My body tells me this in the mornings when I cannot rise without pain. My breath comes short now, and there are days when the pencil falls from my hand before I have written a single word. I do not have much time.

But I have these stories. I have the blank pages. I have the truth that no one wants to hear but that must be told anyway.

The white people have heard only one side of how bad the Apaches were. (They call us Apache, but we are Yavapai—they have never bothered to learn the difference.) They have heard about raids and attacks and savage Indians. They have not heard about broken promises. They have not heard about soldiers shooting women who crawled into rock holes to hide. They have not heard about buckets of lead ricocheting off cave walls until the war songs stopped and there was only silence.

They have not heard Hoomothya's story.

I dip my pencil into the small jar of water to wet the graphite—an old trick that makes the marks darker, easier to read. I smooth the blank page before me. My hand shakes, but I steady it.

Outside, the mesquite sways in the morning breeze. The Verde River runs where it has always run. The land does not change. Only the people do.

I am the only one living to tell.

I pick up my pencil and begin.
