# Archive - Obsolete Planning Documents

## Purpose
This folder contains planning documents that are no longer aligned with the current project structure.

## Archived Files
- `DUAL_NARRATIVE_RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Dual narrative concept (abandoned)
- `Dual_Narrative_Flow_Diagram.md` - Flow diagrams for dual narrative
- `Dual_Narrative_Restructure_Task_List.md` - Tasks for dual narrative structure
- `Dual_Narrative_Synopsis.md` - Synopsis of dual narrative approach
- `POV_and_Voice_Strategy.md` - POV strategy for dual narrative
- `Story_Development_Checklist.md` - Checklist based on old structure with interludes

## Why Archived
The project has shifted away from a dual-narrative structure to a mystery-based reveal structure. The current approach (Chronological_Outline_v2.md) features:
- Single first-person POV (Mike) in Act I
- Third-person manuscript sections in Act II (Mike writing about "Hoomothya")
- No interludes
- Chapter 21 reveal that Mike = Hoomothya

These documents were based on a different structural approach and would cause confusion if kept in the active Planning folder.

## Current Planning Documents
- `Mike_Burns_Novel_PRD.md` - Still relevant as general project vision

## Status
- Reference only
- Do not update
- New planning should align with Chronological_Outline_v2.md
