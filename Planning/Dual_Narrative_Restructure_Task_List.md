# Dual-Narrative Restructure: Master Task List

**Project**: Mike Burns Novel - Fundamental Narrative Structure Change
**Date Created**: 2025-10-06
**Purpose**: Track comprehensive restructuring from linear first-person to dual-narrative mystery structure

---

## CORE CONCEPT

**Original Structure**: Linear first-person narrative, Mike Burns (1934) reflecting on his life as Hoomothya, chronological flashback

**New Structure**: Dual-narrative mystery where:
- **Mike Burns narrative** (first-person): Adult reflecting on life post-capture, education, assimilation, witness
- **Hoomothya narrative** (third-person limited): Young boy's life pre-massacre, told as separate character
- **The Reveal**: Reader discovers they are the same person (around Ch 12-13 or massacre scene)
- **Theme**: Neither identity "fits" into society - split self embodied in narrative structure

---

## PHASE 1: CORE PLANNING DOCUMENTS

### 1.1 New Synopsis & Structure
- [ ] Create `Dual_Narrative_Synopsis.md` - comprehensive overview of new structure
- [ ] Define exact reveal moment (Chapter 12? Chapter 13? Massacre scene?)
- [ ] Map parallel emotional arcs (Mike's adult grief vs Hoomothya's childhood joy → trauma)
- [ ] Determine post-reveal strategy (continue third-person Hoomothya? shift to unified first-person?)

### 1.2 POV & Voice Strategy
- [ ] Create `POV_and_Voice_Strategy.md`
- [ ] Define Mike Burns first-person voice characteristics (adult, educated, witness, trauma-bearer)
- [ ] Define Hoomothya third-person limited voice (child POV, Yavapai worldview, innocence)
- [ ] Establish guidelines for maintaining separation pre-reveal
- [ ] Plan transition strategies for post-reveal chapters
- [ ] Create voice samples for both narrative streams

### 1.3 Narrative Flow Diagrams
- [ ] Create `Dual_Narrative_Flow_Diagram.md`
- [ ] Mermaid diagram: Chapter interleaving pattern (Mike Ch 1, Hoomothya Ch 2, Mike Ch 3, etc.)
- [ ] Mermaid diagram: Identity reveal structure and impact
- [ ] Mermaid diagram: Parallel emotional arcs converging
- [ ] Mermaid diagram: Timeline - dual tracks until convergence

---

## PHASE 2: OUTLINE RESTRUCTURING

### 2.1 Master Scene Plan Revisions
**File**: `Story/Outlines/Master_Scene_Plan.md`

- [ ] **Prologue revision**: Mike Burns (1934) begins writing WITHOUT revealing he is Hoomothya
  - Remove explicit "I was called Hoomothya" statements
  - Create mystery: "There was a boy..." / "I knew a child with another name..."
  - Establish Mike's mission to tell TWO stories: his own and "the boy's"

- [ ] **Chapter 1 NEW**: Mike Burns narrative - post-capture, Carlisle, or adult reflection
  - First-person, establish adult Mike's voice
  - Reference "the massacre" without details
  - Hint at lost identity but don't explain

- [ ] **Chapter 2 (formerly Ch 1)**: Hoomothya's World - CONVERT TO THIRD-PERSON
  - Change all "I" to "he/Hoomothya"
  - Maintain child's perspective through close third-person
  - NO references to "Mike Burns" name

- [ ] **Continue alternating pattern**: Map which chapters are Mike vs Hoomothya
  - Mike chapters: Carlisle, Army service, voter registration, writing
  - Hoomothya chapters: Childhood, growing threat, capture, massacre

- [ ] **Chapter 12-13 (The Reveal)**: Plan exact reveal moment
  - Option A: Massacre scene where Mike writes "That boy was me"
  - Option B: Renaming scene where "Hoomothya became Mike Burns"
  - Option C: 1934 interlude where Mike explicitly connects the narratives

- [ ] **Post-reveal chapters**: Decide on POV strategy
  - Continue alternating third-person Hoomothya flashbacks?
  - Shift all to first-person retrospective?
  - Hybrid approach?

### 2.2 Chapter-by-Chapter Outline
**File**: `Story/Outlines/Chapter_by_Chapter_Outline.md`

- [ ] Restructure entire chapter sequence
- [ ] Mark each chapter: MIKE (1st person) or HOOMOTHYA (3rd person)
- [ ] Ensure narrative tension builds toward reveal
- [ ] Balance chapter lengths between parallel narratives
- [ ] Add "dramatic irony" notes where reader knows more than they realize

### 2.3 Act Structure Revision
- [ ] **Act I**: Introduce BOTH narratives (Mike reflecting + Hoomothya's childhood)
  - Readers believe they're separate people
  - Build Mike's story: educated Native man bearing witness
  - Build Hoomothya's story: innocent child before destruction

- [ ] **Act II**: Deepen both narratives, increase dramatic irony
  - Mike's assimilation, scout service
  - Hoomothya's growing danger, capture, massacre
  - Reveal occurs late Act I or early Act II

- [ ] **Act III**: Post-reveal integration
  - Reader re-interprets everything in light of identity revelation
  - Mike's witness mission takes on fuller meaning
  - Unified narrative drive toward completion

---

## DECISION POINTS (Require explicit choices)

### Critical Decisions Needed:

1. **Chapter 1 Content**:
   - [ ] Option A: Convert current Ch 1 to 3rd person (becomes Ch 2), write new Mike Ch 1
   - [ ] Option B: Make current Ch 1 the new Ch 2 (3rd person), determine what Mike Ch 1 contains

2. **Reveal Placement**:
   - [ ] Option A: Chapter 8 (during/after massacre) - Mike interlude reveals identity
   - [ ] Option B: Chapter 10 (renaming scene) - third-person shows transformation
   - [ ] Option C: Chapter 12-13 (separate reveal chapter) - explicit connection

3. **Post-Reveal Strategy**:
   - [ ] Option A: Continue third-person Hoomothya flashbacks (maintains structure)
   - [ ] Option B: Shift all to first-person retrospective (unified voice)
   - [ ] Option C: Hybrid (some flashbacks remain third-person, others integrate)

4. **Interleaving Pattern**:
   - [ ] Strict alternation (Mike, Hoomothya, Mike, Hoomothya...)
   - [ ] Flexible alternation (2-3 Mike chapters, then 2-3 Hoomothya)
   - [ ] Front-loaded contrast (several Mike, then several Hoomothya, then alternating)

5. **Prologue Treatment**:
   - [ ] Option A: Mike refers to "the boy" without naming him Hoomothya
   - [ ] Option B: Mike says "I must tell two stories: mine and his"
   - [ ] Option C: Mike begins writing without explaining who Hoomothya is

## NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS

### Strengths of This Approach:
- **Embodies theme**: Identity split is structural, not just thematic
- **Mystery drives reading**: "Who are these people? How are they connected?"
- **Emotional impact of reveal**: Reader experiences the erasure viscerally
- **Neither fits**: Mike (educated but not white) and Hoomothya (alive but family dead) both displaced
- **Fresh structure**: Avoids linear chronological monotony
- **Re-readability**: Knowing the truth, readers will re-experience story differently

### Challenges to Address:
- **Maintaining distinction**: Mike and Hoomothya must feel like different people pre-reveal
- **Clues vs. obscurity**: Need enough hints without making it obvious
- **Pacing both narratives**: Each must have its own dramatic arc
- **Reader confusion**: Risk of losing readers if structure is unclear
- **Voice consistency**: Two distinct voices must be maintained throughout
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Ensure structure doesn't feel gimmicky with this subject matter

### Consultation Needed:
- **Sensitivity readers**: How does identity-split structure land? Respectful or exploitative?
- **Yavapai cultural consultants**: Is narrative separation appropriate for this story?
- **Beta readers**: Does mystery work? Is reveal satisfying? Too obvious? Too obscure?

---

**This task list will be updated as work progresses. Mark tasks complete as they are finished.**

**Next immediate steps**:
1. Make critical decisions (Chapter 1, Reveal placement, Post-reveal strategy)
2. Create core planning documents (Synopsis, POV Strategy, Flow Diagrams)
3. Begin Prologue revision to establish mystery
