## Final Notes

**Core Commitment**: This story exists to honor Mike Burns (Hoomothya) and the Yavapai people through the power of STORY. Every decision must be filtered through: "Does this serve Mike's witness, honor his people, AND move readers emotionally?"

**Success Measures**:
1. **Can't-put-it-down test**: Beta readers stay up late to finish chapters
2. **Emotional impact test**: Readers cry, rage, hope, connect—they FEEL Mike's journey
3. **Character test**: Readers see Mike as a real person they care about, not a historical figure
4. **Invisibility test**: Research disappears; readers just experience the story
5. **Authenticity test**: Mike Burns himself would recognize this as true to his witness

**Timeline**: 60 weeks from research initiation to completed manuscript

**Remember**:
- **Story first** - research serves the narrative, never dictates it
- **Show, don't tell** - sensory details and action over exposition
- **Character over facts** - readers connect to people, not events
- **Restraint creates power** - what's not shown can be most powerful
- **Trust readers** - they're smart; let them feel and understand without being told
