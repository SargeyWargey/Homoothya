# The Yavapai People

The Yavapai people are a Native American tribe in Arizona. Historically, the Yavapai were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, with some bands also practicing agriculture. They are divided into four subtribes: the Æ‰o:lkabaya, or Western Yavapai; the Yavbe', or Northwestern Yavapai; the Guwevkabaya, or Southeastern Yavapai; and the Wi:pukba, or Northeastern Yavapai.

## Late 1800s: Conflict and Forced Relocation

The late 19th century was a period of immense hardship and disruption for the Yavapai people. The arrival of American settlers and prospectors in the 1860s, drawn by the discovery of gold in central Arizona, led to increasing conflict.

### The Yavapai Wars

The encroachment on Yavapai lands led to a series of conflicts known as the Yavapai Wars (or Tonto Wars) starting in the early 1860s. These wars were characterized by violence and massacres, such as the Bloody Tanks Massacre in 1864. The U.S. Army established several forts in the region, including Fort Whipple and Fort Verde, to support the American expansion.

In 1872-73, General George Crook led a campaign against the Yavapai and their allies, the Tonto Apache. This campaign resulted in significant loss of life and the forced removal of the Yavapai to reservations.

### The "March of Tears"

In 1875, in an event known as the "Exodus" or "March of Tears," approximately 1,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache were forcibly marched 180 miles from the Rio Verde Reservation to the San Carlos Apache Reservation. This brutal journey, which took place in the winter, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Yavapai from starvation, exposure, and violence. The population of the Yavapai people was decimated, dropping from an estimated 1,500 to just 200 survivors within 25 years.

Life at the San Carlos Reservation was difficult. The land was not suitable for farming, and the Yavapai were often in conflict with the Apache who also lived there.

## Early 1900s: Return and Rebuilding

In the early 1900s, many Yavapai began to leave the San Carlos Reservation and return to their ancestral lands in the Verde Valley. In 1903, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation was established by executive order. In 1910, the Camp Verde Indian Reservation was created, followed by the Middle Verde Indian Reservation. These two reservations were combined in 1937 to form the Camp Verde Yavapai-Apache Nation. The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe was also federally recognized in the 20th century.

Today, the Yavapai people are enrolled in these three federally recognized tribes and continue to work to preserve their culture and traditions.
