## Project Overview

This is a **literary historical fiction novel** about Mike Burns (Hoomothya), a Yavapai survivor of the 1872 Skeleton Cave Massacre. The project is in the **pre-writing/research phase** and consists of documentation, research materials, and planning documents for a 350-page (~87,500 word) emotionally powerful novel.

**This is a NOVEL, not a research paper.** Research serves the story; facts ground the emotion. The goal is to create deep emotional connection with Mike and the Yavapai people, making readers *feel* his journey through:
- Immersive sensory details that bring scenes to life
- Rich character development that reveals humanity, not just historical roles
- Compelling dramatic narrative that honors truth while engaging the heart
- Intimate first-person voice that puts readers inside Mike's experience

**Target**: A novel readers can't put down—one that breaks their heart, changes their understanding, and honors Mike Burns's witness through the power of story.

## Project Phases & Timeline

The PRD outlines a **60-week project** (approximately 14 months):

1. **Research Phase** (Weeks 1-13): Foundation, cultural/contextual, event-specific, character, and setting research
2. **Writing Phase** (Weeks 14-48): Draft all chapters in three acts
3. **Revision Phase** (Weeks 49-60): Expert consultation, feedback incorporation, polish

### Current Phase
The project is in **Phase 0: Planning/Documentation**, setting up the research foundation.

## Story Architecture

**Three-Act Structure with Framing Device:**
- **Prologue**: 1934, elderly Mike Burns begins writing his manuscript at Fort McDowell
- **Act I: Hoomothya** (Chapters 1-12): Childhood through Skeleton Cave Massacre (1865-1872)
- **Act II: Mike Burns** (Chapters 13-24): Carlisle School, Army scout service (1872-1908)
- **Act III: The Witness** (Chapters 25-34): Return to community, writing his story (1908-1934)
- **Epilogue**: Death in 1934, flash-forward to manuscript's publication in 2010/2012
- **Interludes**: 4-6 brief returns to 1934 writing present throughout the narrative

**Target**: 35 chapters + Prologue + Epilogue = ~87,500 words

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Literary Power First
**This is a novel.** Every scene must:
- Create emotional resonance with readers
- Reveal character through action, dialogue, internal thought
- Use vivid sensory details to immerse readers in the moment
- Build dramatic tension and pacing that keeps pages turning
- Show, don't tell—let readers experience the story

Research provides accuracy; craft provides impact. Never sacrifice emotional truth for historical minutiae.

### 2. Character-Driven Storytelling
- Mike Burns is a fully realized human being, not a historical figure
- Every character (Yavapai family, Captain Burns, Carlisle students) has interior life, contradictions, desires
- Relationships drive the plot—show Mike's connections, conflicts, transformations
- Dialogue reveals personality and relationship dynamics
- Internal monologue exposes Mike's evolving consciousness

### 3. Historical Accuracy (Grounding the Story)
- Major dates, events, and figures verified against primary sources
- Mike Burns's own testimony honored as emotional bedrock
- Never alter documented facts, but dramatize them vividly
- Document creative interpretations for author's note
- Facts serve the narrative; they don't dictate it

### 4. Cultural Respect & Authentic Humanity
- **Mandatory consultation** with Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation cultural experts
- Minimum 2-3 sensitivity readers (at least one from Yavapai community)
- Yavapai characters are complex individuals, not cultural representatives
- Show Yavapai life with specificity—the smell of mesquite smoke, the rhythm of language, the texture of daily moments
- Cultural practices woven naturally into scenes, not explained like a textbook

### 5. Emotional Truth Over Exploitation
- Handle trauma (Skeleton Cave Massacre) through Mike's subjective experience—what he felt, not graphic detail
- Emotional impact comes from restraint and intimacy
- Show moral complexity without neat answers
- No romanticization, no "noble savage" tropes—just human truth
- Silence and what's unsaid can be as powerful as what's shown

## Research Philosophy: Mining for Story Gold

**Research Purpose**: Find the sensory details, emotional moments, and human truths that bring scenes alive.

Don't research to report facts—research to:
- Discover what Mike *felt* when the desert wind carried the scent of soldiers
- Learn how mesquite beans tasted in his mouth as a child
- Understand what words his mother might have whispered at night
- Find the small human details that make readers say "I'm there, I feel this"

### Primary Sources (Essential Reading)
1. "The Only One Living to Tell" (2012) - Read for Mike's voice, his way of seeing, what moved him to write
2. "All My People Were Killed" (2010) - Read for the emotional core of his testimony
3. Sharlot Hall Museum Archives - Hunt for personal details, the life behind the facts
4. Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center - Find the human stories behind institutional records
5. U.S. Army records - Translate military jargon into human experience

### Research Focus: What Makes Scenes Breathe
- **Yavapai life**: Specific sensory details—food preparation, the sound of language, seasonal rhythms, how children played
- **Arizona Territory**: What the land looked/felt/smelled like; how people moved through it
- **Carlisle**: The texture of uniforms, the taste of institutional food, the sound of forbidden language whispered at night
- **Scout service**: The weight of a rifle, the exhaustion of tracking, the silences between scouts and soldiers
- **Emotional landscape**: What fear/grief/hope/betrayal actually felt like in the body

## Consultation Requirements

### Before Writing
- [ ] Contact Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation cultural preservation office
- [ ] Engage Yavapai cultural expert for ongoing consultation
- [ ] Recruit 2-3 sensitivity readers (minimum one Yavapai)
- [ ] Engage historical consultants (Arizona Territory, military, Carlisle)

### During Writing
- Monthly check-ins with cultural consultants
- Act completion reviews by cultural experts
- Document all cultural practices and verify authenticity

### During Revision
- Full manuscript review by all consultants
- Prioritize cultural feedback above all other revisions
- Be prepared for significant rewrites based on consultant input

## Working with Research Materials

### Documentation Standards
- Cite all sources for historical facts and quotes
- Flag uncertain facts with `[CHECK]` tag during writing
- Maintain "historical liberties" log for creative interpretations
- Cross-reference major events with multiple sources
- Document contradictions in historical record

### Character Development
- Base characterizations on documented evidence when available
- Distinguish documented traits from creative interpretation
- Consult on appropriate Yavapai naming practices
- Never create names without cultural guidance

## Quality Standards

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All historical facts verified and accurate
- ✅ Cultural consultant approval on Yavapai representation
- ✅ Sensitivity reader approval (minimum 2/3 positive)
- ✅ Complete three-act structure with clear character arc
- ✅ Compelling emotional narrative that honors the truth
- ✅ 87,500 words (+/- 10%)
- ✅ Professional manuscript formatting
- ✅ Comprehensive author's note and bibliography

### Writing Craft Priorities

**Voice and POV:**
- First-person intimate—readers live inside Mike's skin
- Child's wonder/confusion (Act I) → young man's conflict (Act II) → elder's reflection (Act III)
- Based on Burns's own voice: direct, unflinching, occasionally poetic
- Maintains Yavapai way of seeing even when speaking English
- Never "historical" or stiff—always immediate and alive

**Scene Craft:**
- **Start scenes in motion** - action, dialogue, sensory moment (not exposition)
- **Specific over general** - "the scar above his left eye" not "he looked mean"
- **Sensory immersion** - What does this moment smell/taste/sound/feel like?
- **Emotional subtext** - What's happening beneath the surface?
- **End with tension** - Pull readers into the next scene

**Dialogue:**
- Natural, revealing character and relationship
- Period-appropriate without sounding forced or archaic
- Subtext—what people don't say matters as much as what they do
- Rhythm and silence—pauses speak volumes

**Pacing:**
- Vary sentence length: short for tension, longer for reflection
- Action scenes move fast; emotional processing needs space
- Trust readers—don't over-explain
- White space and chapter breaks create breathing room

**Punctuation and Style:**
- **Minimize em-dashes**: Use sparingly throughout the entire novel. Em-dashes should be reserved for rare moments of maximum impact, not as routine punctuation. Prefer commas, periods, and varied sentence structure instead.
- Avoid overuse of semicolons; prefer clear, direct sentences
- Let white space and paragraph breaks create rhythm

## When Working on This Project

### Always Remember
1. This story exists to honor Mike Burns and the Yavapai people
2. Filter every decision through: "Does this serve Mike's witness and honor his people?"
3. Transparency, respect, accuracy, and literary quality are non-negotiable
4. When in doubt, consult - never assume cultural practices or historical facts

### Start Here
1. Read [Mike_Burns_Novel_PRD.md](Planning/Mike_Burns_Novel_PRD.md) for comprehensive project plan
2. Review [Story_Development_Checklist.md](Planning/Story_Development_Checklist.md) for current phase tasks
3. Check [Research/Story_Development/RESEARCH_PHASE_SUMMARY.md](Research/Story_Development/RESEARCH_PHASE_SUMMARY.md) for completed research overview
4. Review character files in [Characters/](Characters/) directory
5. Check event documentation in [Events/](Events/) directory
6. Consult primary sources before making any historical claims

### File Organization Guidelines
When creating new files, follow this structure:

**Research files** → `Research/` subdirectories:
- Cultural research → `Research/Cultural/`
- Historical analysis → `Research/Historical/`
- Story development notes → `Research/Story_Development/`
- Character research → `Research/Character/`

**Character profiles** → `Characters/`
- Main character files (Mike, Captain Burns, etc.)
- Character development notes

**Historical events** → `Events/`
- Specific historical events and institutions

**Locations** → `Places/`
- Geographical locations and settings

**Manuscript work** → `Story/` subdirectories:
- Chapter drafts → `Story/Drafts/`
- Scene experiments → `Story/Scenes/`
- Outlines → `Story/Outlines/`

**Primary sources** → `Manuscripts/`
- Original documents and source materials

**Bibliography** → `Sources/`
- Citations, references, source notes

### Red Flags - STOP if you find:
- **Explaining instead of showing** - "He was sad" vs. "He couldn't lift his eyes from the ground"
- **Historical voice creeping in** - "It was the year 1872 when..." vs. living in the moment
- **Cultural content without verification** - Never assume; always consult
- **Facts drowning emotion** - Research should be invisible, woven into the fabric
- **Stereotypes or romanticization** - Yavapai people are individuals, not noble archetypes
- **Telling readers how to feel** - Let the story do its work

### Green Lights - You're on track when:
- **Readers forget they're reading** - They're just *there* with Mike
- **Scenes have texture** - You can smell the mesquite, feel the stone cave walls
- **Characters surprise you** - They act like real people with contradictions
- **Emotion builds organically** - From specific details, not abstract statements
- **Dialogue crackles** - You can hear distinct voices
- **Silence speaks** - What's not said carries weight

## Project Success Measures

**Primary Goal**: A novel that breaks readers' hearts and changes how they see history—not through lectures, but through lived experience.

**Benchmark**: Could you hand this to someone who's never heard of Mike Burns, and would they:
1. Be unable to put it down?
2. Feel genuine grief, hope, rage, connection?
3. See Mike as a real person they care about?
4. Come away understanding something profound about survival, identity, and witness?
5. Want to learn more about the real Mike Burns and the Yavapai people?

**Ultimate Success**: A manuscript that Mike Burns himself would recognize as true to his life and worthy of his witness—told as a story that makes people *feel* what it meant to be him.
