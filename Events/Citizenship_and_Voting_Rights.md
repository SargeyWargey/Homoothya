# Native American Citizenship and Voting Rights

## The Burke Act of 1906

### Official Name
**The General Allotment Act Amendment of 1906** (also called the Forced Fee Patenting Act)

### Purpose
The Burke Act amended the Dawes Act of 1887, which had distributed communal tribal land to individual Native Americans.

### Key Provisions

**Citizenship Requirements**:
- Withheld citizenship privileges until "the expiration of the [25-year] trust period and when the lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee"
- This was a significant change from the original Dawes Act, which had granted citizenship more immediately upon allotment

**"Competency" Standard**:
- Any Indian who had taken up residence apart from the tribe
- Who had "adopted the habits of civilized life"
- Such individuals were declared citizens with all rights, privileges, and immunities of citizenship
- The U.S. Secretary of the Interior had to determine they were "competent enough to handle his own affairs"

## Mike Burns's Historic Voter Registration (July 15, 1908)

### The Milestone
Mike Burns, identified as an "Apache Mohave Indian" in records (though he was Yavapai), registered to vote on **July 14, 1908**, becoming **the first Native American in the Arizona Territory to register** under the Burke Act of 1906.

### Newspaper Coverage
The **Prescott Weekly-Journal Miner** reported on **July 15, 1908**:
> "the First Indian in the Territory to take advantage of the Act of Congress of 1906, entitling educated Indians who have severed tribal relations to the full rights of citizenship"

### Significance
This was a groundbreaking moment occurring:
- **16 years before** the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted citizenship to all Native Americans
- **40 years before** most Native Americans in Arizona gained full voting rights in 1948
- At a time when most Native Americans had no path to citizenship or voting

### Why Mike Burns Qualified
Mike Burns met the Burke Act's requirements:
1. **"Educated"**: Attended Carlisle Indian School (1880-1885) and Highland University (1885-1886)
2. **"Severed tribal relations"**: Captured as a child, raised by Captain Burns, lived apart from Yavapai community
3. **"Adopted civilized habits"**: Military service, Western education, lived in white society
4. **Deemed "competent"** by the Secretary of the Interior

### The Irony
To exercise his rights as a citizen, Mike Burns had to prove he was no longer culturally Yavapai—the very people whose witness and story he would later dedicate his life to preserving.

## Broader Context: Native American Citizenship and Voting

### Before 1906
- Some Native Americans could gain citizenship through:
  - Serving in the U.S. military
  - Accepting land allotments under the Dawes Act
  - Marrying white citizens
  - Special treaties
- Most Native Americans were not U.S. citizens and had no voting rights

### Indian Citizenship Act of 1924
- Granted citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States
- Did NOT automatically grant voting rights

### Continued Disenfranchisement
Even after the 1924 Act:
- Native American citizens could be denied voting if they failed to:
  - Meet registration requirements
  - Pay poll taxes
  - Meet educational qualifications
  - Satisfy other state-imposed requirements
- **Seven states still refused to grant Indians voting rights in 1938**
- **Native Americans who were granted citizenship under the 1924 Act may not have had full voting rights until 1948**

### Arizona Voting Rights
- **1908**: Mike Burns becomes first registered Native American voter in Arizona Territory
- **1924**: Indian Citizenship Act passes, but Arizona continues restrictions
- **1948**: Arizona finally grants full voting rights to Native Americans
- Even after 1948, barriers to Native voting continued through various discriminatory practices

## Story Research Notes

**Mike Burns's 1908 Voter Registration**:
- This was an act of assertion—claiming rights that most of his people would be denied for decades
- It required him to publicly affirm his separation from his people
- The newspaper called him "Apache Mohave" (incorrect)—another erasure of Yavapai identity
- What did it feel like to be the "first"? Pride? Loneliness? Anger at the irony?

**The Paradox**:
- To gain citizenship and voting rights, he had to prove he was no longer "Indian"
- Yet his life's work became preserving the Yavapai story and witnessing their truth
- He used the rights granted to the "civilized" Indian to speak for those denied those rights

**Questions for Novel**:
- Did Mike Burns vote in the 1908 elections? What was that experience like?
- How did other Yavapai people view his voter registration? Pride? Resentment? Indifference?
- Did he understand the historical significance at the time, or did that come later?
- How did this moment shape his understanding of his role as a witness?

**Scene Possibilities**:
- The act of registration at the county office
- Reading the newspaper article identifying him as "Apache Mohave"—how did that feel?
- Conversations with white citizens about his registration
- Potential confrontations with those who opposed Native voting
- Internal reflection on what he had to give up to gain these "rights"
