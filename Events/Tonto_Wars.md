# The Tonto Wars

The Tonto Wars were a series of conflicts in the Arizona Territory between the United States Army and the Yavapai and Tonto Apache people, which took place in the Tonto Basin and surrounding areas from 1866 to 1875.

## Causes of the Conflict

The primary cause of the Tonto Wars was the encroachment of American settlers and miners onto the traditional lands of the Yavapai and Tonto Apache. The discovery of gold in the region in the 1860s led to a massive influx of outsiders, creating competition for resources and leading to violence.

In 1871, in an attempt to quell the violence, the U.S. government established the Rio Verde and San Carlos reservations and ordered all Yavapai and Tonto Apache to move to them. However, many refused to leave their ancestral lands, leading to the escalation of the conflict.

## General Crook's Campaign

In 1872, General George Crook was placed in command of the Arizona Territory and tasked with ending the conflict. Crook employed a strategy of using mobile units of soldiers and Apache scouts to track and engage the Yavapai and Tonto Apache bands.

Crook's campaign was brutal and effective. His troops relentlessly pursued the Yavapai and Tonto Apache, destroying their villages and food supplies. One of the most infamous events of the campaign was the Skeleton Cave Massacre in December 1872, where U.S. soldiers surrounded a cave where a band of Yavapai had taken refuge and killed 76 of them, including women and children.

## Aftermath

By 1873, most of the Yavapai and Tonto Apache had been forced to surrender and move to the reservations. The Tonto Wars resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Yavapai and Tonto Apache and the loss of their traditional way of life.

In 1875, the Yavapai and Tonto Apache were forcibly marched from the Rio Verde Reservation to the San Carlos Reservation in what is known as the "March of Tears." This event, along with the violence of the Tonto Wars, had a devastating impact on the Yavapai and Tonto Apache people.
