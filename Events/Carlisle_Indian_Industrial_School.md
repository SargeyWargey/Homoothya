## Student Experiences & Testimonies

### Transformation Ceremony
Upon arrival, students underwent forced cultural transformation:
- Hair cutting (significant cultural violation for many tribes)
- Assignment of "American" names
- Uniformed dress
- English-only language policy

**Luther Standing Bear (Oglala Lakota)** recalled: "Now, after having my hair cut... I felt that I was no more Indian but would be an imitation of a white man."

**Zitkala-Sa (Dakota woman)** remembered her first day: School officials dragged her from her hiding place under a bed, tied her to a chair, and forcibly cut her thick braids: "Then I lost my spirit."

### Life Conditions

**Harsh Realities**:
- 1928 U.S. government report found children were abused, overworked, and underfed
- Regimented schedule from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM
- Forced labor starting at age 9
- Strict punishment for speaking Native languages
- Cultural suppression in the name of "civilization"

**Disease and Death**:
- At least **168 children died** from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and flu at the school
- Another **500 students were sent home** when they became too sick and weak to study
- Inadequate medical care
- Overcrowded conditions

### Resistance and Survival
- Some students like Ethil Wheeler attempted to run away multiple times
- Students found ways to maintain cultural connections despite suppression
- Formation of bonds between students from different tribes
- Both cruelty and occasional unexpected kindnesses from staff

## The Outing System

### Overview
The Carlisle Summer Outing Program started in **1880**, developed by Richard Henry Pratt, who called it **"the supreme Americanizer."** The system placed students with white families or businesses to learn "American ways" through immersion and labor.

### How It Worked

**Student Placement**:
- Students worked in homes as domestic servants, on farms, or in businesses
- Most children lived and worked with assigned families for summers
- Some students stayed with families throughout the entire school year
- Students earned wages (Pratt ensured bank accounts were set up for participants)

**Work Assignments by Gender**:
- **Boys**: Farm work, store work, agricultural labor
- **Girls**: Domestic tasks, housekeeping, household service

**Geographic Locations**:
- Many placements with Quaker families in eastern Pennsylvania
- Pennsylvania Dutch Country (Dauphin, Lancaster, and Lebanon counties)
- Students often acquired Pennsylvania Dutch accents from their placements

### Program Growth

- **1880**: 24 children sent out (most host families returned them to school)
- **1881**: 109 children participated (only 6 returned to school)
- **1885**: Nearly 250 children in summer program, 100+ continued during school year

### Purpose
The stated goal was "to impart the lesson of Americanism"â€”total cultural assimilation through living and working with white families. Students were expected to adopt white American customs, speech patterns, and ways of life.

## Richard Henry Pratt's Philosophy

### Background
**Richard Henry Pratt** (1840-1924) was a United States Army officer who founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania in 1879 and served as its longtime superintendent.

### The "Kill the Indian" Philosophy

**Famous Quote** (delivered at the National Conference of Charities and Correction, Denver, 1892):
> "Kill the Indian in him, and save the man."

Pratt elaborated: "All the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man."

### Core Beliefs

**Cultural Transformation Through Education**:
- Believed Native American "inferiority" was cultural, not racial
- Argued that Native Americans could become educated and "civilized" if given the same opportunities as whites
- Required students to renounce tribal way of life, convert to Christianity, abandon reservations
- Goal: seek education and employment among the "best classes" of Americans

**Systematic Assimilation Methods**:
- Strip away any trace of tribal culture
- Train students to become "useful" in American industrial society
- Force students to drop Indian names
- Forbid speaking of native languages
- Cut off students' long hair
- Impose white American dress, customs, and Christian religion

### Legacy

**Model for National System**: Carlisle became the model for many Indian boarding schools Native youths were forced to attend from the 1880s until the mid-twentieth century.

**Cultural Genocide**: The American Indian boarding school system that Pratt began has been labeled by many as a form of cultural genocide that adversely affected children, families, and entire tribal nations for generations.

## Story Research Notes

**For Novel Writing**:
- Mike Burns arrived in September 1880 at approximately age 15
- He had just witnessed the Skeleton Cave Massacre and lived with Captain Burns for ~8 years
- The contrast between Yavapai childhood and Carlisle regimentation is critical for emotional arc
- His articles for *School News* show he engaged intellectually with the "Indian Question"
- Need to explore: What did he feel when his hair was cut? What language did he speak with other students? How did he process the cultural suppression after already losing his family?

**Sensory Details Needed**:
- Smell of institutional food vs. traditional Yavapai cooking
- Sound of bells and whistles vs. natural Arizona soundscape
- Feel of uniform fabric vs. traditional clothing
- Taste of dining hall meals
- Visual contrast: Pennsylvania landscape vs. Arizona Territory
- Sounds of forbidden languages whispered in dormitories

**Emotional Beats**:
- Arrival and transformation ceremony (hair cutting, naming)
- First days of English-only rule
- Industrial training assignments
- Relationships with other Native students
- Internal conflict: survival through assimilation vs. cultural identity
- Writing for *School News* - finding voice even within oppressive system
