# The Tonto Basin Campaign (1872-1873)

## Background

The Tonto Basin Campaign, also known as the Tonto War, was a major military offensive by the United States Army against the Yavapai and Tonto Apache people in the Arizona Territory. The campaign was the culmination of years of escalating conflict between American settlers encroaching on native lands and the indigenous tribes who considered the area their home. By 1871, Arizona's Territorial Governor, Anson P.K. Safford, successfully lobbied President Ulysses S. Grant for a more decisive military solution to end the hostilities.

In response, the U.S. Army appointed General George Crook to command the Department of Arizona. Crook, a veteran of the Civil War and other Indian Wars, was known for his relentless and effective, if often brutal, tactics. Upon his arrival, he established a clear ultimatum: all Yavapai and Tonto Apache bands were to report to designated reservations by February 15, 1872, or be considered hostile and subject to military action.

## General Crook's Strategy

Crook's strategy was a departure from previous, less successful efforts. He understood that conventional warfare was ineffective against the mobile and elusive bands of warriors who knew the terrain intimately. His plan was built on two key elements:

1.  **Use of Native Scouts:** Crook heavily recruited scouts from other tribes, including the Paiute, Hualapai, and even rival Apache bands. These scouts were essential for tracking, intelligence gathering, and navigating the difficult terrain. They could match the skills of the Yavapai and Tonto warriors and were crucial to locating their hidden rancherias.
2.  **Relentless Winter Campaign:** Traditionally, warfare ceased during the harsh winter months when tribes would retreat to their strongholds to wait out the cold. Crook decided to press the attack during this vulnerable period, denying his enemies any rest or opportunity to regroup and resupply. He organized several mobile, self-sufficient columns of soldiers to operate simultaneously and continuously throughout the Tonto Basin.

The offensive officially began on November 15, 1872, with troops converging on the Tonto Basin from multiple forts, including Fort Verde, Fort Apache, and Fort McDowell.

## Key Events

The campaign was characterized by constant pursuit and numerous small, deadly skirmishes rather than large-scale battles. The Army's objective was to harass, capture, or kill the warriors and destroy their food stores, homes (wickiups), and resources, making survival outside the reservations impossible.

### The Battle of Salt River Canyon (Skeleton Cave Massacre)

The most infamous engagement of the campaign occurred on December 28, 1872. Guided by Apache scouts, a column of soldiers under Captain William Brown discovered a large group of Yavapai warriors, along with their families, sheltered in a large, shallow cave in the Salt River Canyon.

The Yavapai refused calls to surrender. In response, the soldiers took up positions on the rim of the canyon and fired directly into the cave entrance. Others ricocheted bullets off the cave's ceiling, causing deadly shrapnel to rain down on the people inside. After the initial volleys, the soldiers stormed the cave. Approximately 75 Yavapai were killed, including many women and children. Only a handful of children survived. The site became known as Skeleton Cave due to the remains of the victims that were left there for years. This event dealt a devastating blow to the morale and fighting capacity of the Yavapai.

### The Battle of Turret Peak

Another significant defeat for the tribes occurred on March 27, 1873. Captain George M. Randall's troops and Apache scouts surprised a Yavapai and Tonto Apache band at their stronghold on Turret Peak. The warriors, caught off guard, were routed. Many were killed in the attack, while others chose to leap from the cliffs rather than be captured or killed by the soldiers.

## Surrender and Aftermath

The relentless pressure of the winter campaign, combined with the shocking losses at Skeleton Cave and Turret Peak, broke the resistance of the Yavapai and Tonto Apache. Throughout the spring of 1873, bands began to surrender at Fort Verde and other military posts. By April, the war was effectively over.

The surrendered people were forced onto the newly established Rio Verde Reservation. However, this was temporary. In 1875, in a decision that proved catastrophic, the U.S. government forcibly marched the approximately 1,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache from the Rio Verde Reservation over 180 miles to the San Carlos Apache Reservation. This brutal trek, known as the "Yavapai Exodus," resulted in the deaths of hundreds from starvation, disease, and exposure.

The Tonto Basin Campaign successfully achieved its military objective of ending the war and opening the region for American settlement, but it did so at a terrible cost to the indigenous populations, leading to their subjugation, displacement, and the loss of their ancestral homelands.
