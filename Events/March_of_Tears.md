# The Yavapai March of Tears (February 1875)

The Yavapai March of Tears, also known as the **Yavapai Exodus** or **Exodus Day**, was the forced relocation of approximately **1,400 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people** by the U.S. Army on **February 27, 1875**.

## Background

### Camp Verde (Rio Verde) Reservation
In the early 1870s, the U.S. government established the Camp Verde Reservation (Rio Verde Reserve) for the Yavapai and Tonto Apache people. The Yavapai had developed successful irrigation systems and were farming the land, making it productive and fertile.

### Breaking the Promise
The government had promised the Yavapai that the Rio Verde land would be theirs forever. However, in **1875, President Ulysses S. Grant signed an order** abolishing the Rio Verde Reserve and instructing the Army to relocate the tribes to San Carlos Apache Tribe land in Southeastern Arizona.

### The "Tucson Ring"
The relocation was driven by:
- **Settlers wanting the fertile land** for themselves
- **The "Tucson Ring"**: A group of Southern Arizona businessmen who sold overpriced tribal rations to the federal government
- These businessmen petitioned to move the Yavapais and Apaches to less fertile ground to increase their profits from government contracts

## The Forced March

### The Journey
**Distance**: Over 180 miles from Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos Reservation
**Date**: Government closed the reservation in **March 1875** (despite the exodus beginning February 27)
**People relocated**: 1,400 Yavapai and Tonto Apache

### Brutal Conditions
- **Winter trek** through snow-covered mountains and flooded rivers
- **No wagons provided** - people walked the entire distance
- **No rest stops** allowed
- **Little food** and inadequate clothing for harsh conditions
- **Rivers of melted snow**: Many drowned while being forced across
- **Whippings**: Yavapai were beaten with whips to keep them moving
- **No mercy**: Anyone who lagged behind was left behind or shot

### Death Toll
- **Over 100 died during the march itself**
- **Total deaths attributed to the march: 375**
- The combination of exposure, starvation, disease, drowning, and violence created a catastrophic loss of life

## Aftermath

### Devastation at San Carlos
The survivors of the March of Tears were forced to live on the San Carlos Reservation, where they faced:
- Further hardship and deprivation
- Conflict with other Apache tribes also confined there
- Less fertile land, making survival more difficult
- Continued government neglect and abuse

### Population Collapse
**Catastrophic demographic decline**:
- **Before 1875**: Approximately 1,500 Yavapai
- **After 25 years at San Carlos**: Only 200 survivors remained
- The population plummeted by over 85% due to the march, disease, starvation, and harsh conditions at San Carlos

### The Return (1900)
- **By 1900**, most surviving Yavapai left the San Carlos Reservation
- They returned to the Verde Valley and neighboring homelands
- Many resettled at Fort McDowell and other areas closer to their ancestral territories

### Mike Burns and the March of Tears
**Timeline Context**:
- **December 1872**: Mike Burns (Hoomothya) captured after Skeleton Cave Massacre
- **February 1875**: The March of Tears occurs when Mike is approximately 10 years old
- Mike was living with Captain James Burns at this time, not with the Yavapai people
- He was spared the March of Tears because of his adoption by Burns
- This created another layer of survivor's guilt and separation from his people

[CHECK: Was Mike Burns aware of the March of Tears as it happened? Did he learn about it later? How did this affect his identity and his relationship with the Yavapai community?]

## Legacy and Commemoration

Today, the Yavapai people are enrolled in several federally recognized tribes, including:
- Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation
- Yavapai-Apache Nation
- Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe

The March of Tears is remembered as a tragic event in Yavapai history and is **commemorated annually by the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation** as Exodus Day.

**Historical Significance**: The March of Tears represents one of many forced relocations of Native American peoples, comparable to the Cherokee Trail of Tears and other acts of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the U.S. government in the 19th century.
