# The March of Tears to San Carlos (February 1875)

**Date**: Latter part of February 1875
**Route**: Rio Verde Agency to San Carlos Reservation
**Distance**: Approximately 180 miles through rough Arizona Territory
**Duration**: ~20 days
**People Forced to March**: Approximately 2,000 Yavapai and Tonto Apache
**Deaths**: 30-35 Tontos killed in conflict on East Verde River; unknown number from hardship

**PRIMARY SOURCE**: Mike Burns's manuscript provides the ONLY detailed first-person account of this forced relocation. His testimony is authoritative.

The March of Tears was the forced removal of approximately 2,000 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people from their home at Rio Verde to the distant San Carlos Reservation in February 1875. This march broke General George Crook's solemn promise that they could stay at Rio Verde "as long as they lived." Instead, they lived there only two years before being marched into exile. The journey was toilsome, rations ran short, and violence erupted. The promised return in "5-7 years" never came. Mike Burns witnessed this betrayal as a 10-11 year old boy—another breaking of his world.

## Background: The Broken Promise

### What Was Promised (1873)

After the Skeleton Cave Massacre and subsequent surrender in April 1873, General George Crook gathered all Yavapai and Tonto Apaches at Camp Verde/Cottonwood—approximately 3,500 people.

**Crook's Promise**:
> They could stay at Rio Verde "**as long as they lived**"

Mike's account makes clear this was not a vague suggestion but a specific, solemn promise Crook made repeatedly to the gathered peoples.

**What They Built** (1873-1875):
For approximately two years, the Yavapai and Tontos lived at Rio Verde Agency:
- Raised crops: wheat, barley, corn
- Received daily rations: flour, sugar, coffee, beans, bacon, fresh beef
- Built homes and community
- Believed Crook's promise
- Began to rebuild lives after the war

**The Hope**:
After genocide and defeat, they had a promise: "as long as they lived." They could stay home. They could rebuild. The war was over.

### The Disease Outbreak

**Tragedy During Peace**:
While living at Rio Verde, a disease outbreak killed approximately **1,500 people**—nearly half the population.

**Yavapai Belief**:
The Indians believed **Dr. Josephus Williams** poisoned them. Whether this was true or the disease was natural (likely cholera, typhoid, or similar epidemic), the Yavapai saw it as betrayal. They were dying even in "peace."

**The Bitter Irony**:
More Yavapai died from disease at Rio Verde (~1,500) than were killed in all the battles and massacres of the war. They survived Skeleton Cave, survived surrender, and then died by the hundreds from sickness.

**Population Before March**:
After disease, approximately 2,000 people remained of the original ~3,500.

### The Order to Move (February 1875)

**Crook's Betrayal**:
In the latter part of February 1875, General Crook broke his promise. Orders came down: the Yavapai and Tontos must leave Rio Verde and move to San Carlos Reservation.

**The Second Promise**:
To ease resistance, Crook made another promise: they could return to the Verde Valley in **5-7 years**.

**Mike's Testament**:
> "General Crook's fine promises, however, were never carried out."

They never returned. The 5-7 year promise was a lie—whether Crook believed it himself or knew it was false to prevent resistance.

**Why Force the Move?**:
Unclear from Mike's account. Possible reasons:
- Government wanted to consolidate tribes on fewer reservations
- Rio Verde land was desired by white settlers/miners
- Cost savings from running fewer reservations
- Punishment for disease outbreak (blaming victims)
- Policy decision from Washington overriding Crook's authority

Whatever the reason, "as long as they lived" became two years.

## The Journey (February 1875)

### The Start

**Date**: Latter part of February 1875
**Starting Point**: Rio Verde Agency, Verde Valley
**Destination**: San Carlos Reservation, Gila River bottomlands
**Distance**: Approximately 180 miles
**Terrain**: Rough Arizona Territory—mountains, rivers, desert

**Who Marched**:
- Approximately 2,000 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people
- Men, women, children, elderly
- People weakened by disease outbreak
- Families carrying what possessions they could
- Those who had believed the promise

**Military Escort**:
- U.S. Army troops to "guide" (guard) the march
- Likely included scouts (Apache, possibly Pima/Maricopa)
- Officers enforcing the relocation

**Mike's Situation**:
Mike Burns, age 10-11, was traveling with Captain James Burns's widow and family, or possibly already with Lieutenant Bishop. He witnessed the march from the military side but knew these were his people being forced into exile.

### The Toilsome Journey

**Duration**: Approximately **20 days**

**Mike's Description**:
> "~20 days, toilsome"

**What "Toilsome" Meant**:
- Rough terrain through mountains and valleys
- February weather—cold nights, possibly rain/snow
- Long daily marches
- Weakened people (from disease, age, childhood)
- Limited rest stops
- Inadequate shelter during journey
- Emotional exhaustion from forced exile

**Rations**:
> "Rations ran short"

At some point during the 20-day journey, the food supplies became insufficient. People who had been promised care were now going hungry on a forced march from their home.

**The Cruelty**:
They were being marched away from land where they'd successfully raised wheat, barley, and corn—proving they could feed themselves—to a distant reservation where they'd be dependent on unreliable government rations.

### Violence on the East Verde River

**The Conflict**:
Somewhere along the East Verde River, violence erupted between different groups.

**The Combatants**:
- **Tontos** (Tonto Apache, who had lived at Rio Verde with Yavapai)
- **Apache Yumas/Mojaves** (Tolkepaya Yavapai - Mike's wife's people)

**The Cause**:
Mike doesn't specify what triggered the fight. Possible factors:
- Old tribal conflicts reignited under stress of march
- Disputes over scarce rations
- Blame for the forced relocation
- Territorial/cultural differences
- Accumulated tensions from living together at Rio Verde

**The Casualty Count**:
> "30-35 Tontos killed"

This wasn't a skirmish. This was significant violence—dozens dead. The exact circumstances are unclear, but the death toll suggests sustained fighting or a concentrated attack.

**Al Sieber's Wound**:
During this conflict, **Al Sieber** (chief of scouts, prominent frontier figure) was **shot through the stomach**.

**Result**:
> "Became lame for life"

Sieber survived but was permanently disabled by the wound. This detail suggests the violence was serious enough to catch even experienced scouts/soldiers in the crossfire.

**The Bitter Irony**:
Yavapai and Apache peoples, who had surrendered to end the killing, were killing each other on a forced march from their promised home. The "peace" had become another kind of war.

### Arrival at San Carlos

**The Destination**:
San Carlos Reservation, located on Gila River bottomlands in southeastern Arizona.

**Mike's Description**:
> "Thrown among a lot of people they did not know"

**What This Meant**:
San Carlos was already home to various Apache bands:
- Chiricahuas
- San Carlos Apaches
- Pinals
- Cibecues
- Arivaipas
- White Mountain Apaches
- Coyoteros

The Yavapai and Tontos were forced to live among these diverse groups—some friendly, some hostile, all struggling with their own traumas and displacements.

**The Reality**:
- Different languages and dialects
- Different customs and traditions
- Old intertribal conflicts
- Competition for limited resources
- No autonomy or self-governance
- Dependent on government rations
- Far from their homeland in Verde Valley

**The Loss**:
> "Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land."

## The Aftermath and Legacy

### The Broken Promises: A Pattern

**First Promise** (1873):
"As long as they lived" → **2 years**

**Second Promise** (1875):
"Return in 5-7 years" → **Never**

**The Pattern**:
This wasn't unique to Crook or the Yavapai. This was the pattern of American Indian policy:
- Make promises to end resistance
- Break promises when convenient
- Make new promises to prevent uprising
- Break those too
- Repeat

**Mike's Understanding**:
By the time Mike wrote his manuscript (1910-1934), he understood this pattern intimately. He documented Crook's promises and their breaking not with surprise but with the weary recognition of someone who had seen it happen repeatedly across his life.

### Impact on the People

**Cultural Destruction**:
The march didn't just relocate bodies—it destroyed:
- Connection to sacred lands
- Agricultural self-sufficiency (they'd been successfully farming)
- Community cohesion (violence between groups)
- Trust in American promises
- Hope for stability

**Psychological Impact**:
- Trauma of forced removal
- Grief for those lost (disease, violence on march)
- Anger at broken promises
- Fear of future betrayals
- Despair about ever returning home

**Mike's Personal Impact** (Age 10-11):
As a Yavapai boy raised by Army officers, Mike experienced this in a unique, painful way:
- He was traveling with the people forcing the march
- He was watching his people being exiled
- He understood both perspectives
- He could do nothing to stop it
- He was learning that promises meant nothing

**The Seeds of His Testimony**:
This experience—watching Crook's promises broken, seeing his people marched into exile—was part of what drove Mike to write his manuscript decades later. The world needed to know what happened. The promises needed to be documented, and their breaking needed to be recorded.

## For the Novel: The March of Tears as Narrative

### Why This Event Matters

**Thematically**:
The March of Tears embodies every major theme of Mike's story:
- **Broken Promises**: "As long as they lived" vs. 2 years
- **Systematic Violence**: Not just massacre, but ongoing destruction
- **Loss and Displacement**: Forced from home despite surrender
- **Witness**: Mike seeing it happen, unable to stop it
- **Moral Complexity**: Crook made and broke promises—was he lying or overruled?

**Structurally**:
For a three-act novel, the March of Tears could serve as:
- **Transition from Act I to Act II**: Childhood world (Yavapai life) → Adopted life (military/white society)
- **Mirror to Skeleton Cave**: Another destruction, different method
- **Character Development**: Mike learning that survival requires accepting broken promises

### Possible Scenes

1. **The Announcement** (February 1875):
Word spreads through Rio Verde: they must leave. Disbelief. Anger. Despair. Crook's new promise: "5-7 years." Some believe it. Others know better.

2. **The Departure**:
Looking back at Verde Valley. The crops they planted. The homes they built. "As long as they lived" echoing in their minds. The forced march beginning.

3. **Mike's Divided Experience**:
Traveling with the military escort. Seeing his people march past. Unable to speak to them (separated by his adoption). Watching from the "winning" side while his people lose again.

4. **The East Verde Violence**:
The fight erupting. Mike witnessing Yavapai and Apache killing each other. Al Sieber shot. The bitter irony of Indigenous peoples fighting each other during forced exile from broken promises.

5. **Arrival at San Carlos**:
"Thrown among a lot of people they did not know." The crowding. The strangeness. The realization: they're never going home.

6. **Mike's Internal Conflict**:
How does he process this? He's being raised by the people who forced this march. He understands why his people are angry. He can do nothing. The guilt, helplessness, rage, grief.

### Character Development

**What This Does to Mike** (Age 10-11):
- Learns promises mean nothing
- Sees his people betrayed again
- Understands he's on the "wrong" side of history
- Begins to internalize the survivor's burden
- Witnesses violence his adoption can't protect him from seeing
- Develops the determination to eventually tell this story

**What This Reveals About Crook**:
- Capable of making solemn promises
- Capable of breaking them
- Whether from policy pressure or personal choice—doesn't matter to the marchers
- The "just and kind" general is also the promise-breaker

**What This Shows About the System**:
- Treaties/promises are tactical, not sacred
- Indigenous peoples have no real rights, only revocable privileges
- Even "successful" assimilation (farming peacefully) doesn't guarantee safety
- The goal is removal, regardless of behavior

## Thematic Significance

### The Geography of Broken Promises

**Rio Verde to San Carlos**: 180 miles that represented:
- "As long as they lived" → exile
- Home → strange land
- Self-sufficiency → dependence
- Community → fragmentation
- Promise → betrayal

**The 20-Day Journey**: Long enough for:
- Hope to fade
- Bodies to weaken
- Violence to erupt
- The full weight of betrayal to sink in

### The Pattern of American Indian Policy

**The March of Tears wasn't unique**:
- Cherokee Trail of Tears (1838): Forced removal, ~4,000 dead
- Navajo Long Walk (1864): 300+ mile march, hundreds dead
- Yavapai March of Tears (1875): 180 miles, dozens dead from violence alone

**The Pattern**:
1. Make promises to end resistance
2. Break promises when convenient
3. Force relocation to less desirable land
4. Use military force to ensure compliance
5. Make new promises to prevent uprising
6. Repeat

**Mike's Witness**:
By documenting this pattern in his manuscript, Mike was doing more than telling his personal story—he was creating a historical record of systematic betrayal.

## A Final Note: The Second Exile

For the Yavapai people, the March of Tears was the second great trauma in three years:

1. **December 28, 1872**: Skeleton Cave Massacre—approximately 225 killed, military defeat
2. **April 1873**: Surrender at Camp Verde—the end of freedom
3. **1873-1875**: Rio Verde—two years of hope, farming, rebuilding
4. **February 1875**: March of Tears—exile from promised home

They survived massacre. They survived surrender. They rebuilt. They farmed. They believed the promise.

And then they were marched 180 miles into exile among strangers, on a journey where their own people killed each other, where rations ran short, where "5-7 years" meant "never."

Mike Burns was 10-11 years old when he witnessed this. He was traveling with the Army that forced the march. He was watching his people lose their home again.

Sixty years later, when he wrote his manuscript, he remembered:
> "General Crook's fine promises, however, were never carried out."

Simple words. Devastating truth.

The March of Tears wasn't the biggest tragedy in American history. It wasn't the longest forced march. It didn't kill the most people.

But for approximately 2,000 Yavapai and Tonto Apache individuals—men, women, children who had believed "as long as they lived"—it was the journey that proved promises meant nothing.

And Mike Burns made sure we would know.
