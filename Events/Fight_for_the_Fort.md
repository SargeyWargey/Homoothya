# Two cousins saved their people's homeland

**On September 15, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fort McDowell Reservation—but this was just the beginning of a two-decade fight for survival.** Carlos Montezuma (Wassaja), a Chicago physician, and his cousin Mike Burns (Hoomothya), a community leader and Skeleton Cave Massacre survivor, formed an unlikely but devastatingly effective partnership that prevented the U.S. government from forcibly relocating the Yavapai people and appropriating their water rights. Their collaboration combined Montezuma's national platform and professional credentials with Burns' local knowledge and community organizing, creating a model for Native American advocacy that would influence resistance movements for generations. This partnership saved Fort McDowell from extinction during its most vulnerable decades, when Phoenix's explosive growth and the Salt River Project's water demands threatened to erase the Yavapai from their ancestral lands entirely.

Both men carried profound trauma from childhood. Montezuma was captured by Pima raiders at age five in 1871 and sold for thirty silver dollars; Burns witnessed soldiers massacre his extended family at Skeleton Cave in 1872, where up to 100 Yavapai men, women, and children were killed. Despite being educated in white institutions and separated from their people for years, both men returned to defend Fort McDowell when it mattered most, transforming from survivors of genocide into architects of Yavapai survival.

## The Yavapai faced extinction before the reservation was created

The Yavapai people numbered approximately **6,000 across 9-12 million acres** of central Arizona before American colonization. By 1903, fewer than 400 survived. The Skeleton Cave Massacre of December 28, 1872, where U.S. cavalry troops killed up to 100 Yavapai in a dawn attack, effectively ended armed resistance. Just two years later, in February 1875, approximately **1,400-1,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache were forcibly marched 180 miles** from the Rio Verde Reservation to San Carlos Apache Reservation in what became known as the Yavapai "Trail of Tears." At least 115 died during the winter march, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war for nearly 25 years.

When the U.S. Army finally allowed Yavapai to leave San Carlos after 1899, about 400 returned to find their lands claimed by settlers. Some settled at the abandoned Fort McDowell military post along the Verde River. Recognizing this vulnerable population's desperate need for land protection, **President Roosevelt's September 15, 1903 executive order carved out 24,680 acres** from the abandoned military reservation—a mere 0.2% of the Yavapai's original territory, but crucially, it included the Verde River and existing irrigation infrastructure.

The executive order specifically reserved land "for the use and occupancy of such Mojave-Apache Indians as are now living thereon or in the vicinity," though the "Mojave-Apache" designation reflected Anglo confusion rather than accurate tribal identity—these were Yavapai people. The order included "the immediate site of the old camp, the post garden, the U.S. Government Farm, the lands lying north of the old camp and embracing or containing the old government irrigation ditch, and the target practice grounds." This foundation provided approximately 1,300 acres of cleared fields and functioning canals, essential for survival in the Arizona desert.

## Montezuma transformed from assimilationist to fierce tribal defender

Born as Wassaja around 1866 near Four Peaks in the Superstition Mountains, Carlos Montezuma became **the first male Native American to earn a medical degree** when he graduated from Chicago Medical College (Northwestern University) in 1889. His adoptive father, Italian photographer Carlo Gentile, purchased him for $30 from Pima raiders in November 1871 and christened him "Carlos Montezuma." Gentile even briefly exhibited the boy in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show as "Azteka, the Apache-child of Cochise."

Montezuma's extraordinary education included honors graduation from Urbana High School in 1879, a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois in 1884 (where he was the first Native American student and president of his class), and five years of medical training during which he worked in pharmacies to support himself. His medical school classmate Charles Mayo—who would go on to found the Mayo Clinic—remained a lifelong friend, demonstrating the elite professional networks Montezuma could access.

From 1889 to 1896, Montezuma served as physician at various Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities including Fort Stevenson, Western Shoshone Agency, Colville Agency, and most significantly, Carlisle Indian Industrial School under founder Richard Henry Pratt. These experiences exposed him to BIA corruption, inadequate supplies, and policies that kept Native Americans dependent. **President Theodore Roosevelt offered him the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1906, which Montezuma declined**, and President Woodrow Wilson later made a similar offer. Montezuma refused both, believing the Bureau itself should be abolished rather than reformed.

The pivotal transformation came in **1901, when Montezuma returned to Arizona independently** and reconnected with his cousin Mike Burns and other relatives including George and Charles Dickens at Fort McDowell. According to sources, "Montezuma's hatred for the reservations softened once he saw how connected his people were to their ancestral land and understood that they considered it home." This visit sparked his lifelong commitment to protecting Fort McDowell specifically—not as an abstract policy position, but as a personal mission to defend his family.

**From 1910 to his death in 1923, Montezuma led the resistance** to multiple government attempts to relocate the Yavapai and appropriate their water rights. His methods were sophisticated and multifaceted, leveraging every advantage his education and professional status provided while maintaining deep connection to his Yavapai roots.

## The physician wielded his credentials as a weapon for his people

Montezuma's advocacy arsenal combined traditional political lobbying with innovative media strategies that were decades ahead of their time. In **April 1916, he launched "Wassaja: Freedom's Signal for the Indians,"** a monthly newsletter he self-published at considerable personal expense until November 1922, just two months before his death. Named after his Yavapai birth name meaning "beckoning" or "signaling," Wassaja became the most important independent Native American publication of its era, relentlessly criticizing the Bureau of Indian Affairs and documenting Fort McDowell's struggles with water rights and relocation threats.

His most famous speech, **"Let My People Go," delivered September 30, 1915** at the Society of American Indians conference, explicitly invoked Moses and declared: "The Indian Bureau system is wrong. The only way to adjust wrong is to abolish it, and the only reform is to let my people go." The speech was published in American Indian Magazine and **read into the Congressional Record on May 12, 1916**, where it remains preserved in Volume 53, pages 7843-7845 of the 64th Congress. In it, Montezuma called the Indian Bureau "that crawling, sneaking, squeezing, lapping, and sucking, devilish vampire of civilization" and argued that the Bureau's 8,000 employees and $11 million budget existed to perpetuate Native American dependency for its own institutional survival.

Montezuma strategically used his medical credentials to gain access to power. **In 1911, he testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Expenditures in the Interior Department** alongside attorney Joseph W. Latimer and brought Yavapai witnesses including Mike Burns and the Dickens brothers. This Congressional testimony provided a national platform to expose the government's relocation scheme and water rights violations.

He also conducted what we would now call "publicity campaigns," leading delegations of influential white allies to witness conditions firsthand. **In 1912, he brought prominent Chicago physicians and John Tinney McCutcheon, the Chicago Tribune's editorial cartoonist**, to Fort McDowell. In 1913, he returned with McCutcheon again alongside John M. Oskison, a writer and editor for Collier's magazine. These visits generated sympathetic media coverage that created political pressure on the Bureau.

Montezuma's financial support extended beyond advocacy to direct aid. Despite never achieving financial security in his medical practice—he often treated poor patients for little or no payment—he used his resources to help Fort McDowell community members. His correspondence reveals requests from relatives for everything from winter coats ordered from Montgomery Ward catalogs to funds for organizing trips to Washington, D.C.

Perhaps most importantly, **Montezuma co-founded the Society of American Indians in 1911**, the first national Native American rights organization created by and for Native people. Alongside Charles Eastman, Arthur Parker, Gertrude Bonnin (Zitkala-Sa), and others, Montezuma built a pan-Indian movement. By 1918, he had persuaded the organization to vote for abolishing the Bureau of Indian Affairs entirely—his ultimate goal. He attended nearly every SAI conference from 1912 to 1922, using these gatherings to build alliances and coordinate strategy.

## Burns found his voice by documenting the truth soldiers wanted forgotten

Mike Burns was born around 1865 as Hoomothya ("Wet Nose" or "Moist Nose") into the Kwevkepaya (Southeastern) Yavapai tribe. His trajectory to advocacy began in tragedy. When he was approximately five years old, soldiers shot his mother multiple times as she tried to hide him. **At age eight on December 28, 1872, he witnessed the Skeleton Cave Massacre**—one of only a few young survivors. Captain James Burns took the orphaned boy as a ward and servant, somewhere between adoption and captivity, and renamed him "Mike Burns."

Burns' education followed the assimilation model the government intended: sent to Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania as one of the first students in September 1880, attending Highland University in Kansas for a year, and serving as an Army Indian Scout from 1885 to 1888 under General George Crook. He participated in campaigns against Sitting Bull after Little Bighorn and against Geronimo in the Apache Wars—fighting against other Native peoples on behalf of the U.S. military. From 1890 to 1894, he worked as issuing clerk at San Carlos Reservation before returning to the Verde Valley to work as a farm hand, wood cutter, and cattle helper near Mayer, Arizona.

Despite this deep immersion in white institutions, Burns maintained his Yavapai identity. He married a Yavapai woman and gradually took on leadership roles within his community. His evolution as an advocate shows a clear progression from witness to voice to leader.

**In 1908, Burns became the first Native American to register to vote in Arizona Territory** under the Burke Act of 1906, which granted citizenship to "educated Indians who have severed tribal relations." The Prescott Weekly-Journal Miner noted this historic first, and Burns himself wrote to Montezuma: "I was up to Mayer on the election day. I voted for a friend of mine named Judge Ed. W. Wells of Prescott and the Republican for Governor." This was more than civic participation—it was Burns claiming political voice in the system that had nearly destroyed his people.

Burns' most significant act of finding his voice came through his determination to document history from a Yavapai perspective. **In 1910, he wrote to territorial historian Sharlot M. Hall** requesting assistance to publish his autobiography, explaining that he wanted to tell "the other side" of the story about conflicts between Yavapai and settlers. In a **January 7, 1913 letter to Montezuma**, Burns articulated his mission clearly: "I am going to tell the White People that they have heard only one side of the stories about how bad the Apaches were to the whites. It will be a long time yet before I can get to that as you call it The Bloody Cave Massacre and I will tell something about my capture."

This letter reveals Burns' growing confidence as a truth-teller and historical witness. Part of his memoir appeared in Thomas Farrish's multi-volume "History of Arizona" just before World War I, making it one of the first published Native American accounts of the Indian Wars period from a Native perspective. Throughout the 1920s, Burns continued drafting longer versions of his memoir, which would eventually be published as "The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian" (University of Arizona Press, 2012) and "All of My People Were Killed" (Sharlot Hall Museum Press, 2010)—**a full century after his initial 1910 request to tell his story.**

As editor Gregory McNamee noted, Burns' autobiography is unusual because "most Native American biographies are really 'as told to' stories, where the primary source is the author, typically a white person. Mike Burns kept a journal, so in this case the Native American is the actual primary source." This makes Burns' account exceptionally valuable—an unmediated Yavapai voice documenting genocide, survival, and resistance.

## Burns provided the ground intelligence while Montezuma fought the national battle

Burns' role in defending Fort McDowell was fundamentally different from Montezuma's but equally essential. While Montezuma leveraged his external platform and professional networks, **Burns served as community organizer, information conduit, and local leader** who mobilized Fort McDowell residents and maintained communication with Montezuma about threats and needs.

The **Carlos Montezuma Collection at Arizona State University Libraries contains approximately 120 personal letters** spanning roughly 20 years (1901-1923) from Burns, George and Charles Dickens, and other Fort McDowell community members to Montezuma. Historian David Martínez, who transcribed these letters for his 2023 book "My Heart Is Bound Up with Them," describes correspondence covering both "utterly mundane" matters (requests for winter coats, Montgomery Ward catalog orders) and "profound" concerns (organizing Washington D.C. trips, land and water rights anxieties).

One preserved letter shows **Burns and McDowell leaders entreating Montezuma to "help them stay on their land, help them travel to Washington D.C. to request a dam for irrigation, and ask for advice about allotment."** These letters provided Montezuma with specific, actionable intelligence about Bureau of Indian Affairs activities, water rights violations, and community conditions—information he could then publicize in Wassaja or use in Congressional testimony.

A **March 24, 1921 letter from Montezuma to "Cousin Mike Burns"** (preserved in ASU archives, MSS 60 Box 5 Folder 2) shows the dynamic in action. Montezuma wrote urgently warning Burns about engineering surveys and water appropriation plans: "There are engineers around the Verde Valley and a dam is planned to be built at the confluence of the Salt and Verde rivers. Some day a dam will be built and the McDowell land will be flooded and the water will be used for drinking water for the Salt River Valley people. No wonder the McDowell Indians are hoodwinked and urged to move to Salt River reservation. White people's heads are long; they can see many years ahead." Montezuma then urged: **"Mike Burns and the McDowell Indians to keep McDowell land and Verde River water; NOT to move to Salt River Reservation as proposed."**

Burns' local knowledge gave the resistance its foundation. He understood irrigation systems, knew which BIA agents were hostile, could identify community members who might be pressured to accept relocation, and recognized when Bureau actions were part of larger strategies. This ground-level intelligence allowed Montezuma to target his advocacy effectively rather than fighting in the dark.

Burns also participated directly in resistance activities. He was among approximately 20 Yavapai who formally petitioned the BIA stating their wishes to remain at Fort McDowell during the 1911 relocation push. **In 1911, he traveled to Washington for Congressional hearings alongside Montezuma, George Dickens, and Charles Dickens**, providing testimony about conditions and community opposition to removal. His presence gave Congressional committees direct access to Fort McDowell voices rather than relying solely on BIA reports.

## Phoenix's water hunger created an existential crisis for Fort McDowell

The reservation faced systematic attempts to eliminate it through a legal and bureaucratic stranglehold that would force the Yavapai to relocate "voluntarily." The threat emerged immediately after the 1903 establishment. Phoenix's agricultural expansion and the formation of the Salt River Valley Water Users' Association (SRVWUA) in 1903 created insatiable demand for Verde River water. Under the 1902 National Reclamation Act, Roosevelt Dam construction on the Salt River was approved, but SRVWUA stated that **a dam on the Verde River was "essential" to the Salt River Project's success**—and such a dam would flood Fort McDowell's irrigable bottomlands.

The government's strategy was ingenious in its cruelty. Verde River flooding repeatedly destroyed Fort McDowell's irrigation headgates, yet **the federal government refused to fund permanent irrigation infrastructure**, citing cost concerns. This denial was strategic: fewer acres under cultivation would justify lower water allocations in court, which would then justify refusing infrastructure investment—a perfect bureaucratic catch-22 designed to strangle the community.

From 1905 to 1910, the SRVWUA pursued the Hurley v. Abbott litigation to settle regional water rights. The proceedings revealed stunning conflicts of interest. **George Christy, assistant to the government lawyer supposedly representing Fort McDowell, was simultaneously vice president of SRVWUA, friend of the presiding judge, and owner of rights in canal companies.** Territorial Governor Kibbey served as attorney for SRVWUA. Fort McDowell's interests were not genuinely represented, and the tribe's fate was being litigated without their knowledge or proper advocacy.

**On March 1, 1910, Judge Kent issued his decree in Hurley v. Abbott**, allocating Fort McDowell only **390 miners' inches of water—enough for just 1,300 acres.** The decree explicitly justified this meager allocation by stating the government's intent to relocate the tribe to Salt River Reservation. Critically, the Kent Decree violated federal law: it ignored the 1908 Supreme Court decision *Winters v. United States*, which established that Indian tribes are entitled to sufficient water for present and future needs with priority dating to reservation establishment. Fort McDowell had reserved water rights dating to 1903 that should have been paramount, but the territorial court simply disregarded them.

**On January 27, 1911, Interior Secretary Richard Ballinger stated that "it was unlikely any expenditures would be made to repair irrigation fixtures at Fort McDowell."** Less than two months later, on March 22, 1911, the federal government made Salt River Reservation available for Fort McDowell's relocation, and spent $20,000 building canals on the planned tract. This expenditure then became justification for denying funds to Fort McDowell—the government claimed it couldn't afford both.

The legal obstacles were compounded by political and economic forces. Phoenix-area agricultural and development interests wielded enormous political influence. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than defending tribal interests, actively facilitated removal. BIA agents on the ground were instructed to encourage relocation, and several were financially connected to development interests competing for water. An Indian Irrigation Service engineer reviewing Fort McDowell's infrastructure needs actually recommended against approval because the site "was being considered as a reservoir site by Salt River Project," and advised that Indian Service should "be prepared to join with the whites when the matter is further advanced."

The Yavapai faced an additional cruel dimension: the government needed tribal consent for removal under existing law, and attempted to obtain it through economic coercion and misleading promises. The Salt River (Pima-Maricopa) Reservation was presented as superior agricultural land with guaranteed water, but **the Yavapai adamantly refused to move to Pima lands** because Pimas had participated in the raids that killed their families in the 1870s. Historical trauma made this relocation psychologically impossible, yet the government persisted for decades.

## The cousins prevented forced relocation through coordinated resistance

Sources explicitly document that **"Montezuma, the Dickens brothers, and Mike Burns headed off that campaign"** when the Bureau renewed relocation efforts in 1919. This triumvirate formed the core leadership, with Burns providing community organizing and on-the-ground resistance while Montezuma mobilized external pressure.

**The 1911 Congressional hearings represented their first major coordinated victory.** Montezuma testified before the House Committee on Expenditures in the Interior Department from June 5-17, 1911, accompanied by attorney Joseph W. Latimer. Critically, he brought George and Charles Dickens and Mike Burns as witnesses—Fort McDowell voices who could testify directly about conditions, Bureau pressure to relocate, and community opposition. This testimony helped expose the conflicts of interest in the Hurley v. Abbott litigation and the government's strategy of constructive elimination through infrastructure denial.

Throughout the 1910s, Montezuma documented Fort McDowell's water crisis in Wassaja, publishing detailed exposés that created national awareness. His ability to do this depended entirely on intelligence from Burns and other Fort McDowell correspondents, who provided specific facts, dates, and examples of Bureau malfeasance. One Wassaja article detailed how BIA agents were pressuring individual community members, another documented the Kent Decree's inadequate water allocation, another exposed the Salt River Project's plans for Verde River damming.

**The 1918 victory in "keeping Fort McDowell intact"** came after nearly a decade of sustained, coordinated resistance. Multiple factors contributed: Congressional awareness created by the 1911 hearings; negative publicity from Montezuma's writings; the Yavapai's absolute refusal to consent to relocation; and the practical difficulty of forcing removal when the Salt River Pima-Maricopa opposed accepting the Yavapai (who they viewed as historical enemies).

When the Bureau tried again in 1919, Montezuma, Burns, and the Dickens brothers were ready with an established playbook: immediate correspondence alerting Montezuma to the threat; articles in Wassaja exposing the scheme; legal challenges through attorney Latimer; and community solidarity refusing consent. **By this point, Burns and Montezuma had developed such an effective partnership that they could rapidly mobilize coordinated responses** to threats that might have succeeded against a less organized community.

The partnership's effectiveness showed in a 1920 confrontation when Montezuma visited Fort McDowell and "nearly came to blows with agent Byron Sharp on the reservation," with Sharp allegedly handling Montezuma's wife Maria roughly during a dispute. This physical presence—Montezuma actually on the reservation standing with community members—demonstrated that his advocacy wasn't detached policy work from Chicago but personal commitment to his family's survival.

Historian James Q. Jacobs concluded: **"Due largely to the leadership of Dr. Carlos Montezuma, a native Yavapai child purchased and reared by a Chicago couple, the efforts to relocate the Yavapai failed."** But David Martínez's recent archival research reveals the fuller truth: Montezuma's leadership was inseparable from Burns' and the Fort McDowell community's ground-level organizing. Martínez argues that Burns and the Fort McDowell correspondents "gave voice to Carlos Montezuma every bit as much as he gave voice to them."

## Fort McDowell survived and became a model for indigenous resistance

**By Montezuma's death on January 31, 1923, the relocation scheme had been permanently defeated.** Fort McDowell remained intact, the Yavapai had not been forced to Salt River, and the community had established its right to exist on ancestral lands. When Montezuma was dying of tuberculosis in December 1922, he returned from Chicago to Fort McDowell where the Dickens family built him a traditional Yavapai oo-wah (wickiup) along the Verde River. He reportedly visited Skeleton Cave before his death and wept seeing blood stains still visible 50 years later. He died in that wickiup at age 56-58, and was **buried at Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell**—the land he had fought to preserve.

Mike Burns outlived his cousin by eleven years. **On May 28, 1934, Burns moved permanently to Fort McDowell,** where he died six months later on November 26, 1934. He was buried in the same cemetery as Montezuma, their graves marking their shared commitment to Yavapai survival.

The immediate victory expanded into long-term impacts. **In 1939, after Bartlett Dam construction minimized flooding threats, Fort McDowell finally received BIA funding for a small concrete intake dam**—infrastructure that should have been provided in 1910 but was deliberately withheld. The 1948 case of Fort McDowell citizens Frank Harrison and Harry Austin successfully challenged Arizona's denial of Native voting rights, building on Burns' pioneering 1908 registration. When the government proposed Orme Dam in the 1970s, which would have flooded the reservation, Fort McDowell organized resistance invoking Montezuma's legacy; **the community voted 144 to 57 against selling their land in a 1976 referendum, and Interior Secretary James Watt announced in 1981 that Orme Dam would not be built.** The 1990 Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act finally resolved the water rights issues that had plagued the community since 1910, recognizing superior tribal rights to Verde River water.

Today, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation has **950 enrolled citizens** and operates successful gaming enterprises, the Fort McDowell Casino, and other economic development projects. **In 1996, the tribe named its health facility the "Dr. Carlos Montezuma, Wassaja Memorial Health Center,"** permanently honoring the physician who had defended their homeland. The community proudly declares: "We Are Still Here"—a statement that would not be true without the Montezuma-Burns partnership.

For the broader Native American rights movement, their collaboration established crucial precedents. Montezuma co-founding the Society of American Indians in 1911 created the first pan-Indian advocacy organization, providing a model for later movements. His Wassaja newsletter demonstrated that Native-controlled media could expose government malfeasance and organize resistance without relying on sympathetic white publications. The combination of grassroots organizing (Burns' role) with national political advocacy (Montezuma's role) created a dual-track approach that later movements would replicate. The successful resistance to forced relocation showed that tribes could defeat federal policies by maintaining community solidarity, refusing consent, mobilizing educated advocates, and creating political pressure through media exposure.

Their documentary legacy remains invaluable. Montezuma's Wassaja newsletters (1916-1922) are digitized at Arizona State University and provide unparalleled documentation of Progressive Era Indian affairs from a Native perspective. His correspondence, preserved at ASU, University of Arizona, Wisconsin Historical Society, and Newberry Library, totals thousands of letters documenting advocacy strategies, political networks, and community conditions. Burns' autobiography, published a century after he first sought to tell his story, provides one of the only Native American first-person accounts of the Skeleton Cave Massacre and the subsequent decades. The 1903 executive order, 1910 Kent Decree, Congressional testimony transcripts, and other primary sources document both the injustices faced and the resistance mounted.

## Their partnership worked because they occupied complementary worlds

The Montezuma-Burns collaboration succeeded because each man brought distinct, essential strengths that the other lacked. **Montezuma provided external legitimacy, professional credentials, national platform, political connections, media access, and financial resources.** Burns provided internal legitimacy, community trust, local intelligence, organizational capacity, cultural knowledge, and sustained presence. Neither could have succeeded alone.

Montezuma, despite his deep commitment to Fort McDowell, was fundamentally an outsider by geography—living in Chicago, visiting periodically—and by cultural positioning, having been raised entirely outside Yavapai society from age five. His power came precisely from his ability to navigate white institutional spaces, but this also limited his effectiveness within the community. He needed Burns and other Fort McDowell leaders to provide ground-level organizing and community legitimacy.

Burns occupied the mirror position: deeply embedded in Fort McDowell, trusted by community members, culturally Yavapai despite his education—but lacking Montezuma's national platform, professional credentials, and access to political power centers. He needed Montezuma to amplify Fort McDowell's voice beyond local BIA agents and territorial officials to Congressional committees, national media, and the broader Indian rights movement.

Their family relationship as cousins provided personal trust and cultural obligation that sustained the partnership through two decades and multiple campaigns. Both men had survived profound childhood trauma—capture, massacre, forced separation from family—and both had been educated in white institutions while retaining Yavapai identity. This shared experience created mutual understanding of operating between worlds and the psychological complexity of advocating within systems that had tried to eliminate them.

The partnership showed remarkable strategic sophistication. **Burns and Fort McDowell leaders provided specific, actionable intelligence**—not just general complaints but detailed information about which BIA agents were hostile, what arguments they were using to pressure relocation, how water allocations were being manipulated, and which community members might be vulnerable to coercion. Montezuma transformed this intelligence into targeted interventions: Congressional testimony, Wassaja articles, letters to sympathetic officials, and organized delegations to witness conditions.

Communication flowed both directions. Montezuma advised Burns and other leaders on political strategy, warned them about long-term threats they might not see coming (like his 1921 warning about dam plans), provided financial support for organizing activities, and used his medical expertise to address health concerns. The correspondence reveals discussions of everything from Montgomery Ward catalog purchases to constitutional questions about tribal sovereignty—a partnership built on both practical mutual aid and shared strategic vision.

Their division of labor reflected clear role specialization. **Burns rarely left Arizona; Montezuma traveled constantly for advocacy.** Burns organized at the community level; Montezuma organized at the national level through the Society of American Indians. Burns documented Yavapai history and perspective in his memoir; Montezuma documented BIA malfeasance and policy critiques in Wassaja. Burns exercised political voice through pioneering voter registration and community petitions; Montezuma exercised political voice through Congressional testimony and elite political connections. Together, they covered the entire spectrum of advocacy from grassroots to national.

Perhaps most significantly, the partnership transformed both men. Montezuma's 1901 reunion with Burns and his Fort McDowell relatives fundamentally changed his political philosophy from assimilationist to defender of tribal land rights and sovereignty. David Martínez argues convincingly that "letters from Yavapai community members and leaders, including Mike Burns, George Dickens, and Charles Dickens, wrote to Montezuma pleading for help during relocation attempts" and "sparked Montezuma's desperate but principled desire to liberate his Yavapai family and community—and all Indigenous people—from the clutches of an oppressive Indian Bureau." Without Burns and Fort McDowell, Montezuma might have remained a successful Chicago physician with abstract policy critiques rather than becoming the fierce advocate who would die in a traditional wickiup fighting for his people until his last breath.

Burns' transformation was equally profound. From the traumatized eight-year-old survivor taken as a ward by the officer whose troops had just killed his family, Burns evolved into a political pioneer (first Native American to vote in Arizona), historical documenter determined to tell "the other side," and community leader who could coordinate resistance with one of the most prominent Native American advocates of the era. His voice emerged gradually but decisively: the 1908 voter registration claiming political participation, the 1910 letter to Sharlot Hall seeking to publish his story, the 1913 letter articulating his mission to tell the truth about Skeleton Cave, the decades of correspondence providing intelligence to Montezuma, and finally the completion of his memoir preserving Yavapai perspective for future generations.

## Conclusion

The Montezuma-Burns partnership represents one of the most effective indigenous advocacy collaborations of the early twentieth century, yet it remained largely unknown until recent archival research revealed its depth and sophistication. Their success in preventing Fort McDowell's elimination occurred during an era when government policy explicitly sought Native American assimilation and tribal land base reduction—making their victory all the more remarkable.

The partnership established an advocacy model that combined insider and outsider strategies, local and national organizing, community voice and professional legitimacy. This dual-track approach anticipated and influenced later indigenous rights movements, from the Red Power era of the 1960s-70s to contemporary sovereignty struggles. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation's continued existence and prosperity 122 years after the reservation's establishment testifies to the partnership's enduring impact.

Their collaboration also challenges simplistic narratives about Native American responses to colonization and assimilation. Both men were products of the very systems—military conquest, forced separation, boarding school education—designed to eliminate Native identity, yet both dedicated their lives to defending tribal sovereignty and land rights. Their ability to navigate multiple worlds while maintaining commitment to Yavapai survival demonstrates the complex negotiations indigenous people made to ensure cultural continuity.

Most importantly, the Montezuma-Burns partnership reveals that effective indigenous resistance required networks, not isolated heroes. Montezuma has received more historical attention due to his dramatic biography, professional accomplishments, and prolific writings, but recent archival research shows he was inseparable from the Fort McDowell community that directed and sustained his advocacy. Burns and other community leaders were not passive recipients of Montezuma's help but active strategists who mobilized local resistance while coordinating with external advocates. Their partnership saved Fort McDowell not through individual brilliance but through collective action, mutual support, and strategic division of labor sustained across two decades.

When Montezuma died in that wickiup in 1923 and Burns was buried beside him eleven years later, they left a legacy that extended far beyond Fort McDowell's survival. They demonstrated that indigenous peoples could resist elimination, reclaim voice, defend homelands, and build networks powerful enough to defeat federal policies backed by enormous economic and political interests. Fort McDowell's proclamation—"We Are Still Here"—stands as testament to their partnership and to every indigenous community that has refused to disappear.
