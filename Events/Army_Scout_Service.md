# U.S. Army Indian Scout Service (1866-1914)

## Mike Burns's Service

**First Enlistment**: July 1885 - December 1886
**Second Enlistment**: June 1887 - December 1888

Mike Burns served as a U.S. Army Indian Scout in Arizona Territory during the final years of the Apache Wars, particularly during the campaigns tracking Geronimo.

## Duties and Responsibilities

Indian scouts served as:
- **Guides**: Leading troops through unfamiliar terrain
- **Trackers**: Following hostile bands across difficult country
- **Guards**: Providing security for military installations
- **Fighters**: Combat alongside regular troops
- **Cultural translators**: Interpreting between various Apache bands and Americans

**Critical Knowledge**: Scouts had "first-hand knowledge of every trail, every water hole, every hideout in the vast labyrinth of mountains crisscrossing the southwest." They were described as "the eyes and ears of the United States military."

## Major Campaigns (1885-1888)

### Geronimo Campaign (1885-1886)
The primary military operation during Mike Burns's service was tracking and pursuing Apache leader Geronimo and his band:

- **White Mountain Apache scouts** served with Company B under Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood from Fort Apache (1885-1886)
- **Warm Springs Apache scouts** served under Lieutenant Britton Davis, tracking Geronimo and Nana
- The Apache Scouts played a decisive role up to Geronimo's final surrender in 1886

**Tragic Aftermath**: The Apache scouts who helped track Geronimo were sent to Florida by General Miles along with those they had tracked, as if they were hostiles to be punished. They were kept captive as prisoners of war for twenty-six years before being released.

### Post-Geronimo Period (1886-1888)
The Indian Wars in Arizona Territory continued for several years after Geronimo's surrender. [CHECK: Specific campaigns and operations during Mike Burns's second enlistment 1887-1888]

## Pay and Conditions

### Enlistment Terms
- **Pay**: Same as white cavalry soldiers (Army Reorganization Act of 1866)
- **Terms**: Typically 3-6 months enlistment periods, with many scouts serving multiple terms
- **Authorization**: Up to 1,000 Indian scouts could be enlisted across all territories
- **Discharge**: At department commander's discretion when "necessity for further employment is abated"

### Benefits and Motivations
- Army service enabled Native people to earn a living
- Allowed exercise of warrior traditions increasingly discouraged by U.S. officials
- Received uniforms from surplus stock (often worn mixed with native dress)
- Less regimented dress code compared to regular cavalry

## Relationships Between Scouts and White Soldiers

### Trust and Suspicion
**Mutual Doubts**: White soldiers questioned whether Indian scouts would remain faithful or betray them in conflict. However, mutiny was extremely rare—the only recorded 19th-century incident was the Cibicue Apaches at Cibicue Creek in Arizona Territory.

### Tactical and Cultural Differences
**Conflicting Military Views**:
- Pawnee Scout leader Luther H. North: "Neither the Wild Tribes, nor the Government Indian Scouts ever adopted any of the White soldier's tactics. They thought their own much better."
- Major General George Crook: "An Indian fighting as an Indian is an effective soldier; as a member of a civilized army he is useless."

### Treatment and Attitudes
**Equal Pay, Unequal Treatment**:
- While scouts received same pay as white cavalry, attitudes varied widely
- Some white officers respected scouts' abilities; others resented their presence
- Scouts were sometimes allowed to bring wives and families to forts (which white officers disliked)
- Easy desertion was possible since scouts were in their homeland, creating officer tensions

**1891 Integration Attempt**: An experiment to integrate Native Americans into regular Army companies faced resistance. Though authorized for 1,485 Indians, only 780 were actually recruited—Army leadership was not supportive.

## The Moral Complexity

### Scouts Tracking Their Own People
Indian scouts often tracked and fought against members of their own tribes or closely related peoples. This created profound moral conflicts:
- White Mountain Apaches tracking other Apache bands
- Native scouts helping subjugate resistance fighters from their own nations
- The psychological burden of being instrumental in the defeat of one's own people

### Betrayal and Punishment
The most bitter irony: scouts who loyally served the U.S. Army were often treated as enemies afterward:
- Apache scouts who tracked Geronimo were imprisoned with him for 26 years
- No distinction made between scouts and "hostiles" in final disposition
- Loyalty to the Army did not protect them from collective punishment

## Mike Burns's Experience

**Context of His Service**:
- Burns enlisted at approximately age 20 (1885), after 5 years at Carlisle
- He was Yavapai, serving during Apache campaigns
- Already culturally displaced (Raised by Captain Burns, Carlisle educated)
- First enlistment overlapped with Highland University attendance (1885-1886)

**Questions for Story Development**:
- How did Burns reconcile tracking other Native peoples after his own family's massacre?
- What relationships did he form with other scouts? With white soldiers?
- Did he face prejudice despite his "civilized" education?
- How did the moral weight of this service shape his later identity?
- What specific campaigns or actions did he participate in?

## Story Research Notes

**Emotional Landscape for Novel**:
- **Internal conflict**: Serving the same Army that massacred his family
- **Cultural limbo**: Not fully accepted by whites, potentially viewed with suspicion by other Native scouts
- **Moral burden**: Tracking people fighting for freedom he once had
- **Survival strategy**: Using Army service as path to citizenship and acceptance
- **Isolation**: Already separated from Yavapai identity by Carlisle, now furthering that separation
- **Witness to hypocrisy**: Promised equal treatment, experiencing constant othering

**Sensory Details Needed**:
- Arizona Territory landscape during tracking expeditions
- Sounds of cavalry columns, scout communications
- Physical exhaustion of long pursuits in desert terrain
- Smell of horses, leather, sweat, dust
- Taste of army rations vs. traditional foods
- Feel of weapons, tracking signs in earth
- Visual contrasts: scout dress mixed with uniform, white soldiers vs. Native scouts

**Key Scenes to Consider**:
- First day of enlistment - what did it feel like?
- Moments of tension with white soldiers
- Tracking another Native band - the moral weight
- Camaraderie (or lack thereof) with other scouts
- Physical hardships of campaigns
- Decision to re-enlist in 1887 - why?
- Final discharge in 1888 - relief? Uncertainty?
