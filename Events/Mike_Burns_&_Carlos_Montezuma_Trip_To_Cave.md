Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns’ Journey to Skeleton Cave

Historical Context and Motivation

Carlos Montezuma (Wassaja) and Mike Burns (Hoomothya) were cousins from the Yavapai nation, personally connected to the 1872 Skeleton Cave massacre ￼. In that December 28, 1872 attack, over 50 Yavapai men, women, and children were killed by U.S. Cavalry in a shallow cave along the Salt River Canyon, and their bodies were left unburied – giving “Skeleton Cave” its name ￼. Burns, then a young boy, survived the massacre (his mother and family were killed) and was taken in by Captain James Burns of the 5th Cavalry ￼. Montezuma, another Yavapai child captured in a related conflict, grew up to become one of the first Native American medical doctors and an outspoken advocate for Indian rights. By the early 1900s, both men felt a deep pull to address the legacy of Skeleton Cave. The victims’ remains had remained in the cave for decades (a rancher who visited in 1908 found skulls and bones still scattered with personal belongings) ￼. Montezuma and Burns were determined to return to this sacred site to properly lay their people to rest and to confront the painful history. Burns in particular had long wanted to share the Yavapai side of the story – in a 1913 letter to Montezuma he described plans to write about his 1872 capture and to explain that whites had only heard “one-sided stories” portraying Apaches (Yavapais) as villains, when in truth “the Apaches were forced” into fighting to protect their families and land ￼. This sense of duty and personal closure set the stage for their journey back to Skeleton Cave.

Timeline of the Journey
	•	Departure (1923): In December 1922, Dr. Carlos Montezuma left Chicago and returned home to Arizona for the final time, gravely ill but intent on completing his “life’s circle” ￼. In early January 1923, Montezuma and Mike Burns assembled a small party of Yavapai relatives – including Yavapai elder John Williams and brothers George and Charles Dickens – and departed Fort McDowell Reservation for Skeleton Cave ￼ ￼. (Fort McDowell, not far from the Salt River Canyon, served as their base for the expedition.) The exact day is not recorded, but it was only weeks before Montezuma’s death. They likely traveled by wagon or horseback to the canyon’s vicinity and then undertook a difficult hike up 1,200 feet of rugged terrain to reach the cliffside cave ￼.
	•	Return: After retrieving what remains they could, the group returned to Fort McDowell in January 1923. Montezuma, already weak from tuberculosis, survived the arduous trip but grew weaker afterward. He died on January 31, 1923 and was buried on the Fort McDowell Yavapai Reservation ￼. His death so soon after the journey underscores how meaningful this final mission was to him.
	•	Follow-Up in 1925: Two years later, in 1925, Mike Burns organized a second trip to Skeleton Cave to gather any remaining bones and ensure all their slain kin received a proper burial ￼. With the help of a Maricopa County sheriff and several Fort McDowell Yavapais (likely including John Williams), Burns recovered the rest of the skeletal remains from the cave and transported them home ￼. These remains were interred in a mass grave next to Dr. Montezuma’s own grave in the Fort McDowell cemetery – symbolically reuniting Montezuma with his people in death and honoring the massacre victims on Yavapai land ￼. By late 1925 (approximately 53 years after the massacre), the bones of the Skeleton Cave victims had finally been laid to rest at Fort McDowell ￼ ￼.

Purpose of the Trip

The primary purpose of the 1923 expedition was to locate and retrieve the remains of their relatives who had perished in the Skeleton Cave massacre, so that these souls could be given a dignified burial on their home reservation ￼. For Montezuma and Burns, both of whom had survived the violence of the 1870s, the journey was deeply personal. Montezuma saw it as a way to confront a site of great trauma for his people and to fulfill what he felt was a spiritual obligation before he died. Burns was motivated not only by familial duty but also by a desire to document and remember Yavapai history. In his correspondence and memoirs, Burns emphasized telling the truth about what happened at Skeleton Cave and correcting the record of why the Yavapais (“Apaches”) fought – essentially, the trip was as much about remembrance and justice as it was about physical recovery of remains ￼. Both men wanted to ensure the massacre would not be forgotten and that the victims would no longer lie anonymously in a remote cavern. The later 1925 trip led by Burns had a clear practical purpose as well: to gather all remaining bones still in the cave and transport them out for burial ￼. This effort was the culmination of their commitment to honor their people. In sum, the expeditions combined goals of spiritual closure, historical commemoration, and proper reinterment of the Skeleton Cave victims.

Events and Experiences During the Trip

￼The journey to Skeleton Cave was physically challenging and emotionally charged. According to John Williams – who was a young man in 1923 and later recounted the trip – the party made a difficult trek up to the cave, clambering over steep, rocky hillsides in Arizona’s Superstition Mountains backcountry. Upon reaching the rock-shelter cave (an alcove about 40 feet deep under a cliff ledge ￼), they encountered harrowing evidence of the massacre. Scattered across the cave floor were “many bones”, including small bones of children, exactly where the victims had fallen over 50 years earlier ￼. Williams recalled that the cave walls and floor were still stained with blood – dark splashes that had dried black and “looked like oil” spray on the rock ￼. The sight overwhelmed the group. Dr. Montezuma stood by the cave wall crying as they carefully gathered up the skeletal remains of their people; seeing their normally stoic elder break down, “we all start crying right there,” Williams said ￼. It was an incredibly poignant moment – the survivors’ descendants mourning in the very spot where their families had died. They realized “this is here that all our people died. For nothing,” Williams related, reflecting the senseless tragedy of the massacre ￼.

Aside from the somber task of collecting bones, there were a few noteworthy events. The difficult hike up meant the team had to be resourceful; one 1923 letter suggests Montezuma had asked Burns earlier, “Did you really come to that cave at last?”, implying that Montezuma might have attempted such desert hikes before ￼. During the retrieval, the men likely used blankets or sacks to hold the skulls and other remains. There is no detailed diary of each step, but the emotional impact was clearly recorded in oral history. After spending some time praying or paying respects in the cave, the party descended with the remains. They then returned to Fort McDowell, where Montezuma’s health took a turn for the worse. Community members say that Montezuma had exerted himself greatly to reach the cave despite being ill, as if determined to complete this mission before the end of his life ￼. The 1925 follow-up trip led by Mike Burns was more logistically coordinated – Burns enlisted a county sheriff’s help, indicating they wanted legal permission or assistance to remove human remains from public lands ￼. That excursion likely involved a larger team and perhaps pack animals or a vehicle (by the mid-1920s, the Apache Trail road and nearby Horse Mesa Dam construction made the area somewhat more accessible ￼). Burns and his companions again climbed to Skeleton Cave, gathered any remaining bones that had been missed or were too numerous to carry in 1923, and solemnly brought them back to the reservation ￼. No incidents of conflict or accident are recorded during these trips; rather, the accounts emphasize the heart-rending scene at the cave and the reverence with which the Yavapai party carried out their task.

Findings and Discoveries

The expeditions yielded both concrete and intangible “discoveries.” Key findings included:
	•	Human Remains: The team recovered a significant number of skeletal remains from the cave. They found bones of men, women, and children in situ, many lying where they fell in 1872. Williams recalled seeing “lots of little bones” – a tragic confirmation that many children had died there ￼. The remains were gathered carefully for reburial. In 1925, Burns’ party ensured no bones were left behind; by that time, essentially all identifiable remains were removed from Skeleton Cave ￼.
	•	Blood Stains: One striking observation, as noted above, was the dried blood on the cavern walls and floor. After half a century, the blood of the victims had blackened and spread in a sheen, described by Williams as looking like oil splattered everywhere ￼. This grim discovery viscerally confirmed survivors’ oral histories of a close-quarters massacre. It left a deep impression on Montezuma’s group, underscoring the violence that had occurred.
	•	Personal Artifacts: Early visitors to the cave (e.g. rancher Jack Adams in 1908) had reported finding remnants of the Yavapais’ belongings among the skeletons – items like baskets, clothing scraps, or other domestic objects ￼. By the 1920s, many artifacts had been looted or deteriorated, but the retrieval party may still have encountered a few weathered possessions of their kin. These would have further humanized the scene (e.g. cooking implements or beads left from the camp). However, the records focus on the human remains and do not detail specific artifacts taken. It’s possible the group left any objects in place or those had already been removed by looters after 1908 ￼.
	•	Historic Verification: The trip also served to verify the oral accounts of the massacre. Burns and Montezuma confirmed for themselves the exact location and physical evidence of what their people had described. Notably, Burns had been present as a child (though he was outside the cave during the army’s assault), and his recollections matched what they saw ￼. The finding of so many bones and the layout of the cave (a shallow undercut about 65 feet long by 25 feet deep) ￼ matched Lt. John Bourke’s 1872 journal descriptions and proved that the tragedy had unfolded as remembered. For the Yavapai, this was not a “lost” history – but now they had tangible proof to show others if needed.

In summary, the journey yielded the repatriation of the Skeleton Cave victims’ remains as its most important outcome. Those bones were subsequently buried in a single large grave at Fort McDowell, which today is marked by a simple granite memorial stone honoring “the brave Yavapai men, women, and children” who were massacred in that cave ￼. Beyond the physical discoveries, Montezuma and Burns’s trips “found” a sense of closure and truth. They demonstrated to both Yavapai and outside observers that the stories of Skeleton Cave were real and remembered – the cave itself became a kind of open-air tomb that these descendants finally emptied and sanctified with proper rites.

Sources and Historical Accounts of the Trip

Several historical sources document or illuminate Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns’ trip to Skeleton Cave:
	•	John Williams’ Oral Testimony: The most direct account of the 1923 expedition comes from Yavapai elder John Williams, who as a young man accompanied Montezuma and Burns. In 1975, Williams described the cave visit in detail to anthropologist Sigrid Khera, recalling how “in 1923 we went with Carl Montezuma to get the bones from the cave” and the emotional scene that ensued ￼. His testimony, preserved in typescripts of Yavapai oral history, provides vivid first-hand details (e.g. the blood-like “oil” on the walls, Montezuma crying) ￼. This oral history was later cited by historian Timothy Braatz in Surviving Conquest: A History of the Yavapai Peoples, linking Williams’ memories to the broader narrative ￼ ￼.
	•	Mike Burns’ Writings: Mike Burns himself left a written record, primarily about his life and the Skeleton Cave massacre. He spent years working on a memoir, sometimes with assistance from others. Portions of his story were published (with edits) in Arizona’s history volumes before he died in 1934 ￼, and the full manuscript “The Only One Living to Tell” was finally published in 2012 ￼. In it, Burns gives a Native American eyewitness account of the 1872 massacre and its aftermath. While his autobiography focuses on the events of his youth, it underscores why returning to Skeleton Cave mattered so much to him. Additionally, Burns maintained correspondence with figures like Sharlot Hall (an Arizona historian) and Dr. Montezuma. For example, Burns’s January 7, 1913 letter to Montezuma (available in archives) outlined his intent to write about Skeleton Cave and asked for Montezuma’s support ￼. Such letters show that the idea of revisiting the cave and honoring those lost was in their minds years before they actually undertook the trip.
	•	Carlos Montezuma’s Letters and Activism: Dr. Montezuma’s role is further evidenced in letters preserved in the Carlos Montezuma Papers. Montezuma received numerous letters from his Yavapai relatives at Fort McDowell (including his cousins George and Charles Dickens and Mike Burns) pleading for help in the 1910s, which galvanized him to fight for Yavapai land rights ￼ ￼. These letters, transcribed by scholars like David Martínez, show Montezuma’s deep connection with his people’s struggles. Although Montezuma did not leave a known diary of the 1923 cave trip (he was extremely ill afterward), his final actions speak loudly. Community memory holds that Montezuma’s last wish was to see that massacre site reclaimed – a wish he effectively fulfilled. Montezuma’s grave itself became a historical marker: the fact that the 1925 reburial of the Skeleton Cave remains was done beside Montezuma’s gravesite is documented in Braatz’s history, signifying how Montezuma was honored in that process ￼.
	•	Contemporary Reports: There is scant newspaper or official record of the 1923 trip – likely because it was a private spiritual mission rather than a public event. However, the later removal of remains did get noted in historical summaries. The National Park Service, for instance, reports that “beginning in the 1920s, remains of the victims were removed and buried at the Fort McDowell Reservation,” referencing the Yavapai efforts ￼. The Zinn Education Project also mentions that in 1925 the Fort McDowell Yavapais “retrieved the bones of their massacred relatives and brought them home for burial in a mass grave on the reservation” ￼. These secondary sources corroborate the timeline and outcome of Burns’s 1925 expedition.
	•	Lieutenant Bourke’s 1872 Journal and Other Early Sources: While not about the 1920s trip per se, it’s worth noting that John G. Bourke’s contemporaneous diary (he was an Army lieutenant at Skeleton Cave in 1872) provided details of the massacre that were later verified by Montezuma and Burns. Bourke’s journal – describing the cave’s layout, the siege, and the aftermath – remained one of the few written records until the Yavapai accounts emerged ￼ ￼. Montezuma and Burns essentially validated those early records through their on-site observations, bridging a gap between U.S. Army reports and Yavapai oral history.

In conclusion, Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns’s trip to Skeleton Cave stands as a profound historical episode of remembrance. The approximate dates of their journey (early January 1923 departure with a return soon after, followed by a 1925 reburial effort) and its purpose (to recover and honor their people’s remains) are well-attested by Yavapai oral histories and supported by archival letters and historical analyses ￼ ￼. The events of the trip – the arduous hike, the discovery of bones and blood, and the emotional scene of two cousins mourning a past tragedy – have been preserved in both memory and written word. Their findings not only included the physical bones of dozens of massacre victims, but also the “discovery” of healing and justice as they laid those souls to rest. Through sources like John Williams’s testimony and Mike Burns’s writings, we gain a clear picture of this pilgrimage to Skeleton Cave: a journey of two men closing a circle of history, and ensuring that the story of Skeleton Cave would be told by the very people who had endured its pain ￼ ￼.

Sources: Historical accounts were drawn from Yavapai oral histories (e.g. John Williams via S. Khera) ￼, Mike Burns’s memoir and letters ￼, the writings of Dr. Carlos Montezuma and his relatives ￼ ￼, as well as National Park Service and Arizona historical publications that document the massacre and the 1920s reinterment efforts ￼ ￼. These combined sources provide a comprehensive view of Montezuma and Burns’s Skeleton Cave journey and its lasting significance for the Yavapai people.
