# Rio Verde Reservation Period (1873-1875)

**Location**: Rio Verde Agency, near Camp Verde and Cottonwood, Verde Valley, Arizona Territory
**Duration**: Approximately 2 years (1873-1875)
**Population**: Approximately 3,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people initially
**Promise**: "As long as they lived"
**Reality**: 2 years
**Outcome**: Disease killed ~1,500; remaining ~2,000 forced to march to San Carlos in February 1875

**PRIMARY SOURCE**: Mike Burns's manuscript provides the ONLY detailed first-person account of this period. His testimony is authoritative.

The Rio Verde Reservation Period represents a brief, tragic moment of hope between massacre and betrayal. After surrendering in April 1873, approximately 3,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people were gathered at Rio Verde Agency in the Verde Valley. General George Crook made them a solemn promise: they could stay there "as long as they lived." For two years, they built homes, raised crops, and began to rebuild their shattered communities. Then disease killed half of them. Then Crook broke his promise and they were marched into exile. This period shows that even "successful" assimilation—farming peacefully, obeying American rules—offered no real security.

## Background: Surrender and Gathering (April 1873)

### The End of the War

**Skeleton Cave Massacre**: December 28, 1872
**Subsequent Battles**: Turret Peak (March 25, 1873) and others
**Final Surrender**: April 27, 1873 at Camp Verde

**The Surrender**:
After General Crook's relentless Winter Campaign 1872-73, the remaining Yavapai and Apache resistance collapsed. John Gregory Bourke recorded:

"An unprecedented thing began to happen. Each procession was joined by hundreds of 'wild' Apaches. In twos and threes they quietly slipped among the marchers, uttering only the word 'Siquian - my brother' to the scouts who had hunted them."

**The Count**:
When Crook counted all who had surrendered, he found approximately **2,300 captives** initially. Eventually, approximately **3,500 Yavapai and Tonto Apache people** were gathered at Camp Verde/Rio Verde area.

### Crook's Promise

**The Moment**:
After gathering the people at Camp Verde and nearby Cottonwood (across the river from the post), General George Crook addressed them through interpreters.

**The Promise**:
> They could stay at Rio Verde "**as long as they lived**"

**Mike's Account Makes Clear**:
This was not a casual statement or vague suggestion. Crook made this promise **repeatedly** to the gathered peoples. It was a solemn commitment: if they surrendered, if they settled peacefully, if they farmed and obeyed—they could stay home forever.

**Crook's Later Words to Leaders** (per Bourke):
> "If they would live at peace on the Reservation, he promised he would be the best friend they ever had."

**The People's Response**:
They believed him. Most of the bands agreed to move onto the reservation at Fort Verde/Rio Verde. They had fought for their freedom and lost. Now they would try to survive through peace and adaptation.

## Rio Verde Agency: Geography and Setup

### Location

**Rio Verde Agency**: Near Camp Verde and Cottonwood in the Verde Valley
- **Camp Verde**: Military post
- **Cottonwood**: Town across river from post
- **Rio Verde Agency**: Where rations were issued and administrative functions occurred

**The Land**:
Verde Valley—rich agricultural land, well-watered, surrounded by mountains. This was good land, capable of supporting farming. The Yavapai knew this country intimately—it was close to their traditional territories.

### Population Distribution

**Approximately 3,500 people** gathered in the area:
- **Yavapai** (various bands): Kwevkepaya, Tolkepaya, Yavapé
- **Tonto Apache**: Groups that had intermarried and allied with Yavapai

**Diversity Within**:
These weren't a single unified people—they were various bands with different dialects, customs, and historical relationships (some friendly, some tense). Gathering them all together created both community and friction.

### Administrative Structure

**Rio Verde Agency**: Government administrative center where:
- Daily rations were issued
- Officials made decisions
- Records were kept
- Contact with military/government occurred

**Agent**: Government Indian Agent (identity unclear from Mike's account)

**Military Presence**: Camp Verde provided military oversight and enforcement.

## Daily Life at Rio Verde (1873-1875)

### Agriculture: Proving They Could Farm

**Crops Raised**:
- **Wheat**
- **Barley**
- **Corn**

Mike's account makes clear the Yavapai and Tontos successfully farmed during this period. This is crucial—they proved they could be "civilized" farmers, self-sufficient, productive. They were doing exactly what American policy claimed to want.

**The Bitter Irony**:
They were forced from this productive agricultural land to San Carlos—a harsh, less fertile reservation in the Gila River bottomlands. The problem wasn't that they couldn't farm. The problem was that they were farming land white Americans wanted.

### Rations System

**Daily Rations Issued**:
- Flour
- Sugar
- Coffee
- Beans
- Bacon
- Fresh beef

**What This Shows**:
The government was providing substantial daily rations—suggesting they weren't expected to be immediately self-sufficient from their crops alone. This created dependency even while encouraging farming.

**The Pattern**:
1. Take people's traditional hunting/gathering lands
2. Gather them on reservation
3. Provide rations to prevent starvation
4. Encourage farming for self-sufficiency
5. Create dependency on government supplies
6. Use that dependency as control mechanism

### Community Life

**Building Community**:
For two years, these ~3,500 people were:
- Building or inhabiting homes
- Raising crops together
- Participating in ration distribution
- Interacting across band/tribal lines
- Attempting to rebuild after the war
- Living in proximity to Camp Verde and white settlement

**Mike's Limited Perspective**:
Mike was 8-10 years old during this period, living with Captain Burns or transitioning to Lieutenant Bishop. He observed the Rio Verde period from outside—he was with the military, not among his people. His account is therefore more limited for this period, though he documented the key facts: the promise, the farming, the disease, the betrayal.

---

## The Disease Outbreak: First Betrayal

### The Tragedy

**Death Toll**: Approximately **1,500 people** died from disease

**Proportion**: Nearly half the population (1,500 of ~3,500)

**The Disease**:
Mike doesn't specify which disease. Likely candidates given the period and circumstances:
- Cholera
- Typhoid
- Smallpox
- Measles
- Influenza
- Tuberculosis
- Some combination

**Why So Deadly?**:
- Crowded conditions
- Malnutrition/weakened immune systems from war and relocation
- Limited medical care
- Lack of immunity to Euro-American diseases
- Unsanitary conditions common at overcrowded reservations
- Contaminated water supply

### The Yavapai Belief: Poisoning

**Mike's Account**:
> "Indians believed Dr. Josephus Williams poisoned them"

**Dr. Josephus Williams**:
Government doctor or contract physician at Rio Verde. Identity and exact role unclear from Mike's account.

**Why They Believed Poisoning**:
From Yavapai perspective:
- They had survived in this land for generations without mass death
- Disease struck suddenly after concentration on reservation
- American officials controlled their food and water
- They had been promised safety—betrayal through poison seemed plausible
- Distrust of American officials was well-founded based on broken promises
- Mass death served American interests (fewer Indians to feed/manage)

**Was It Poison?**:
Almost certainly not. Mass poisoning would have been difficult to execute and easy to trace. The disease outbreak was likely natural but exacerbated by reservation conditions.

**Why It Matters**:
Whether poison or disease, the result was the same: **massive death during "peace."** The Yavapai lost more people at Rio Verde from disease (~1,500) than they lost in the entire military campaign including Skeleton Cave.

**The Bitter Truth**:
They survived the war. They couldn't survive the "peace."

### Impact on Community

**Population Reduction**:
- Started with ~3,500 people
- Lost ~1,500 to disease
- Remained ~2,000 when forced to march to San Carlos

**Psychological Impact**:
- Grief and trauma from mass death
- Fear that "peace" was another kind of war
- Growing distrust of American promises and care
- Realization that reservation life might be deadlier than freedom
- Questions about whether surrender had been the right choice

**Preparation for Betrayal**:
When Crook broke his promise and ordered the march to San Carlos in February 1875, the people had already learned that American "protection" meant death. The broken promise was almost expected.

---

## Conflicts Between Groups

### Internal Tensions

**Mike Notes**:
> "Conflicts between Tontos and Apache Mojaves/Yumas"

**The Groups**:
- **Tontos** (Tonto Apache): Athapaskan-speaking Apache who had mixed with Yavapai
- **Apache Mojaves/Yumas** (Tolkepaya and Yavapé Yavapai): Yuman-speaking Yavapai often misidentified as "Apache"

**Historical Background**:
These groups had complex relationships:
- Some intermarriage and alliance
- Some historical conflicts
- Different languages and customs
- Different territorial claims
- Different relationships with other tribes

**Why Conflicts at Rio Verde?**:
- Forced proximity of diverse groups
- Competition for limited resources
- Stress from war trauma and disease
- Old grudges reignited
- Blame for current suffering
- Cultural/linguistic differences
- No traditional conflict resolution mechanisms

**Foreshadowing**:
These conflicts would explode into violence during the March of Tears to San Carlos (February 1875), when 30-35 Tontos were killed in fighting on the East Verde River.

## The Broken Promise (February 1875)

### The Order to Move

**Date**: Latter part of February 1875
**After**: Only approximately 2 years at Rio Verde
**Promise**: "As long as they lived"
**Reality**: 2 years

**The Order**:
General George Crook ordered all remaining Yavapai and Tontos to leave Rio Verde and relocate to San Carlos Reservation—approximately 180 miles away in harsh, less fertile country.

**Why?**:
Mike's account doesn't explain the government's reasoning. Possible factors:
- Verde Valley land desired by white settlers/miners
- Cost savings from consolidating tribes on fewer reservations
- Policy decision from Washington overriding Crook's local authority
- Punishment or control measure
- Removal of successful Indian farming as "threat" to white settlers

**Whatever the reason**: The promise was broken.

### The Second Promise

**To Ease Resistance**:
Crook made a new promise: they could return to Verde Valley in **5-7 years**.

**Mike's Testament**:
> "General Crook's fine promises, however, were never carried out."

**The Pattern**:
1. Promise "as long as they lived" to get surrender (1873)
2. Break promise after 2 years (1875)
3. Promise "return in 5-7 years" to prevent resistance (1875)
4. Never allow return (1875-forever)

### The Reaction

**Mike's Remembered Feeling**:
> "Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land."

Even as a 10-year-old, Mike understood: they were never coming home.

**The People's Choice**:
What choice did they have? Resist and be massacred? Trust the new promise? March peacefully and hope? They had 2,000 people, many weakened by disease, children, elderly. The military surrounded them.

They marched.

## Significance of the Rio Verde Period

### What It Proved

**The Lie of Assimilation**:
The Rio Verde period proved that "successful" assimilation offered no security:
- They surrendered ✓
- They settled peacefully ✓
- They farmed successfully ✓
- They obeyed American rules ✓
- **They were forced to leave anyway**

The problem wasn't their behavior. The problem was American land hunger and broken promises.

### What It Destroyed

**Hope**:
For two years, there was hope—"as long as they lived" meant safety, home, peace. The broken promise destroyed that hope forever.

**Trust**:
Any remaining trust in American promises died with "as long as they lived" → 2 years.

**Self-Sufficiency**:
They proved they could farm. They were forced to leave productive land for harsh reservation where they'd be dependent on unreliable government rations.

**Community Stability**:
Two years wasn't long enough to fully rebuild after the war, but they'd started. The forced march broke that fragile stability.

## For the Novel: Rio Verde as Narrative

### Why This Period Matters

**Thematically**:
Rio Verde represents:
- **The False Hope**: Brief period between traumas
- **The Broken Promise**: "As long as they lived" → 2 years
- **The Pattern**: Promise → Compliance → Betrayal → New Promise → Repeat
- **The Impossible Choice**: Assimilate successfully → Get betrayed anyway

**Structurally**:
For a three-act novel:
- **Act I ends**: Skeleton Cave Massacre and surrender
- **Interlude**: Rio Verde period—false hope
- **Act II begins**: March of Tears and exile to San Carlos

### Possible Scenes

1. **The Promise** (April 1873):
Crook addressing the gathered people. The weight of "as long as they lived." Interpreters translating. People choosing to believe because what other choice do they have?

2. **Building Hope** (1873-1875):
- Planting first crops
- Building homes
- Children playing
- Elders teaching traditions
- Fragile community forming
- Mike watching from military side

3. **The Disease Outbreak**:
- Mass death during "peace"
- Bodies piling up
- Dr. Williams's role (real or imagined)
- Yavapai belief in poisoning
- Grief overwhelming relief of survival

4. **The Broken Promise** (February 1875):
- Word spreading: they must leave
- Disbelief, anger, despair
- Crook's new promise: "5-7 years"
- People knowing it's a lie but having no choice
- Looking back at crops they won't harvest

### Mike's Experience (Age 8-10)

**The Divided Perspective**:
Mike was living with the military during this period—either with Captain Burns until his death in 1874, then with Lieutenant Bishop. He was:
- Close enough to see his people at Rio Verde
- Far enough removed that he wasn't living among them
- Young enough (8-10) that he might not fully understand
- Old enough to recognize the promise and its breaking

**For the Novel**:
Mike's perspective on Rio Verde could be:
- Longing to be with his people
- Inability to return to them
- Watching from the military side
- Seeing the promise made
- Witnessing the disease
- Understanding the betrayal
- Powerless to stop any of it

**The Weight**:
This period added to Mike's burden: he was being raised by the people who made and broke the promise. He was among those who forced his people to leave. He understood both perspectives and could fix neither.

## Thematic Significance

### The Illusion of "Peaceful" Assimilation

**The American Narrative** claimed:
- Indians who surrendered would be protected
- Indians who farmed would be supported
- Indians who obeyed would be allowed to stay home
- Reservations were for Indians' "own good"

**Rio Verde proved**:
- Surrender meant vulnerability, not protection
- Successful farming meant nothing if land was wanted
- Obedience bought no security
- Reservations could be broken/moved at will

**The Truth**:
The goal wasn't assimilation. The goal was removal. Whether Indians fought or farmed, they were in the way of American expansion.

### The Pattern of Promise-Breaking

**Rio Verde demonstrates** the systematic pattern:
1. Make solemn promise to end resistance
2. People comply based on promise
3. Break promise when convenient
4. Make new promise to prevent uprising
5. Break that promise too
6. Repeat until all land is taken

**Mike's Testament**:
By documenting "as long as they lived" → 2 years, Mike was creating a historical record of systematic betrayal. This wasn't an isolated incident. This was the pattern.

### The Cost in Human Lives

**The Math**:
- ~3,500 gathered in 1873
- ~1,500 died from disease
- ~2,000 forced to march to San Carlos
- 30-35 more killed in violence during march

**Total Rio Verde "Peace" Deaths**: ~1,500+
**Total Skeleton Cave "War" Deaths**: ~225 (per Mike)

**The Bitter Calculation**:
More Yavapai died during two years of "peace" at Rio Verde than died in the most famous massacre of the war.

## A Final Reflection: "As Long as They Lived"

Two years.

That's how long "as long as they lived" lasted for the Yavapai and Tonto Apache people at Rio Verde.

They surrendered. They farmed. They obeyed. They proved they could be "civilized."

And they were forced to leave anyway.

Half of them died from disease first. The other half were marched 180 miles into exile among strangers, where they'd never see their Verde Valley homeland again.

The promise—"as long as they lived"—became the betrayal that defined American-Yavapai relations. It wasn't unique. It was the pattern. But for the ~3,500 people who believed it in 1873, it was their specific betrayal, their particular grief, their destroyed hope.

Mike Burns remembered. Sixty years later, when he wrote his manuscript, he made sure to document it:

> "General Crook's fine promises, however, were never carried out."

Simple words.

Devastating truth.

The Rio Verde period wasn't the worst thing that happened to the Yavapai people. Skeleton Cave was worse. The March of Tears was worse.

But Rio Verde was perhaps the cruelest—because it offered hope first. It said, "If you do everything right, you can stay home forever."

And then it took it all away.
