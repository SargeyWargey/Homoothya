# The Skeleton Cave Massacre

**CRITICAL NOTE**: The account of Mike Burns (Hoomothya) is the **PRIMARY and AUTHORITATIVE source** for this event. He was forced to witness the massacre of his family and people and is "the only one living to tell" what happened. Where his testimony contradicts secondary sources, **Mike Burns's version takes precedence as eyewitness account.**

**The Skeleton Cave Massacre**, also known as the **Battle of Salt River Canyon** or **Bloody Salt River Cave Massacre** (Mike's term), was a tragic and brutal event that took place on **December 28, 1872**, in the Salt River Canyon of Arizona. It was the darkest moment in Yavapai history and a turning point in the Yavapai War.

## Background and Location

The massacre occurred during the 1872 Tonto Basin Campaign, a major military operation by the U.S. Army aimed at removing the Yavapai and Apache people from their ancestral lands and forcing them onto reservations.

### Geographic Details of Skeleton Cave
The cave is located on the northern wall of the Salt River Canyon near present-day Horse Mesa Dam in Maricopa County, Arizona, hidden in the cliffs between Canyon Lake and Apache Lake.

**Physical Description**:
- A rock shelter formed by an overhang in the cliff wall
- Approximately **118 feet (36 m) wide** and **no deeper than 40 feet (12 m)**
- An elliptical undercut measuring about **65 by 25 feet**
- Sits **1,200 feet (370 m) above the river** at the base of a **170 feet (52 m) cliff**

**Terrain Access**: The cave lies on the canyon's north rim at the angle of a sharp turn to the south. Above the cave is a mesa/plateau from which a trail descends down the cliff face to the cave entrance. The soldiers positioned themselves on this mesa above the rim, then descended to attack.

**Sun Position (Winter)**: Being on the north rim, the cave remains in shadow for much of the winter day, especially in early morning. The south rim across the canyon catches the first sunlight at dawn, while the north rim stays shaded. This tactical disadvantage aided the soldiers' dawn approach.

**Climate (December)**: Winter in central Arizona can bring cold air masses from Canada, with temperatures dropping below freezing at night. The area experiences occasional Pacific storms during winter months (November-March). [CHECK: Specific weather conditions on December 28, 1872]

## The Parties Involved

### The Yavapai (Victims)
A band of Yavapai people—men, women, and children—were sheltering in the cave. **According to Mike Burns's eyewitness testimony, approximately 225 people were in the cave.** They were led by **Chief Delshe** (also spelled Delche, Delchay), a great warrior whose territory was the Four Peaks and Superstition Mountains area.

Among those killed were Mike Burns's family members:
- His father
- His grandfather ("had part of his head in a little rock hole")
- His little brother (whom Mike had cared for since their mother's death)
- His baby sister (~3 years old, whom Mike had cared for)
- His aunt with her 5 children
- His uncle
- His brother-in-law (last person killed, "shot through the bowels," "never known to have ever missed a shot," "killed like a man")

**Chief Delshe**: Killed at Skeleton Cave according to Mike Burns's eyewitness account (contradicting secondary sources that claim he surrendered later). He told his people to get behind the big rocks at the cave front, believing no enemy would dare attack their fortified position.

### The U.S. Army
The soldiers were from the 5th U.S. Cavalry, under the overall command of General George Crook.

**Command uncertainty**:
- **Mike Burns states** Captain James Burns (his captor) commanded the operation
- **Secondary sources state** Captain William H. Brown led 130 troopers from 5th US Cavalry
- Both may have been present with different roles; **Mike's testimony is authoritative for his experience**

### Native American Scouts
The U.S. Army was aided by approximately 30 Apache scouts, plus Pima and Maricopa scouts. These scouts played a crucial role not only in finding the cave but in brutal acts after the shooting stopped—crushing the heads of wounded survivors with rocks.

## The Events Leading to the Massacre

On December 22, 1872, Captain James Burns captured a young Yavapai boy named **Hoomothya** (who would later be known as Mike Burns). The boy was captured on the mesa/plateau above the canyon rim while gathering firewood. For six days, the boy was held captive as the soldiers positioned themselves for the attack.

## The Attack

### Tactical Approach
The troops began their final approach at **8:00 PM on December 27**, using stealth tactics learned from their scouts. They wore moccasins stuffed with dry grass instead of heavy cavalry boots to move silently. They reached the mesa above the canyon rim **4¼ hours later** (around 12:15 AM), and Apache scouts reported seeing fires in the cave far below about **2:00 AM on December 28**. The soldiers camped on the mesa throughout the night, positioned above the cave on the north rim.

### Dawn Assault
At dawn on December 28, the soldiers and scouts descended from the mesa to positions around the cave. The north rim remained in shadow while the south rim across the canyon caught the first light, giving the soldiers cover in darkness as they positioned themselves. Inside, the Yavapai were celebrating a recent successful raid with dancing. When Captain Brown's men called for surrender, according to John Bourke's diary, "The only answer was a shriek of hatred and defiance" and threats from the Yavapai.

Soldiers opened fire on the men, women, and children. Some of Brown's men aimed for the cave roof, causing bullets to ricochet off the stone ceiling into the people below. In a particularly brutal tactic, soldiers positioned on the mesa above also rolled large boulders down from the rim, crushing those seeking shelter at the cave entrance.

**John Bourke's Account**: Bourke documented a particularly haunting moment in his diary: "At one point in the battle, a 4-year old boy ran to the mouth of the cave 'and stood thumb in mouth, looking in speechless wonder and indignation at the belching barrels.'"

The Yavapai were trapped and outgunned, and the attack quickly turned into a massacre.

## The Massacre - Mike Burns's Eyewitness Account

### What Mike Witnessed

Mike Burns was forced to witness the massacre of his family and people. His testimony provides the authoritative account of what happened:

**The Method**:
> "My people thought that they were strongly protected and could not see to shoot the soldiers. But the soldiers were ordered to shoot down volleys of buckets of lead behind those big boulders, so that the walls of the cave would scatter the glancing bullets into the people beneath. **The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans. The war songs ceased.**"

**The Last Fighter**:
> "It happened that only one was left alive. As he had only one shot left, he killed one Pima Indian at noon. He might have killed more, but when he reached out with the barrel of his gun to reach a bag of gunpowder, a bullet or two struck the gun so that it bent nearly double. He was left in a hole helpless. Finally he was shot. He was my brother-in-law. He was never known to have ever missed a shot. He was the last one to be killed, and he was killed like a man."

**After the Shooting Stopped**:
The Pima and Maricopa scouts rushed into the cave after the last shots were fired. They crushed the heads of any wounded survivors with rocks—"traditional enemies of the Yavapais" seeking revenge. Mike witnessed this brutality:

- One badly wounded woman who could not sit on a horse was left behind with food and water. When the soldiers were out of sight, some Pimas went back and "smashed her head to jelly."
- Some women and children were saved by Apache scouts who gave them to the soldiers.
- The Pimas and Maricopas wanted to kill the Apache scouts too.

**What Mike Saw**:
> "I saw dead men and women lying around in all shapes, horrid to look on. I saw where my grandpa lay; I saw at a distance a body that was in a little rock hole, headfirst, and that was the old man."

**His Moral Crisis**:
> "What would I do? Should I give myself up to the Pimas and Maricopas to be killed there with my family? Should I forget those awful deeds against my people and take on a new and manly courage, resolve to be a different man and hope for a better future?"

### Mike's Testimony

> "In all history no civilized race has murdered another as the American soldiers did my people in the year 1872. They slaughtered men, women, and children without mercy, as if they were not human."

> "**I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people.**"

## Casualties and Aftermath

### Casualty Numbers: Mike Burns is Authoritative

**Mike Burns (eyewitness)**: Approximately **225 people** were in the cave

**U.S. Army records**: 54-76 dead, 20-35 captured/wounded

**Contradiction analysis**: Significant discrepancy exists. **Mike Burns's count is authoritative as eyewitness.** Secondary sources may have undercounted or Mike's memory includes the total band size. The lopsided casualty ratio (one Pima scout killed vs. 225 Yavapai) justifies the term "Massacre."

### Immediate Aftermath

The bodies of the victims were left in the cave—this is how it earned the name "Skeleton Cave." The bones lay virtually undisturbed from December 28, 1872 until January 1908 when rancher Jack/Jefferson Davis Adams led a group to the cave and photographer Lubken took photos of remains.

**Looting occurred**:
- 1905-1911: During Roosevelt Dam construction
- 1984: Phoenix outdoor writer pictured illegally taken material
- Metal detectors used, floor dug down 3+ feet

**Bones removed and reburied**:
- Beginning in 1920s: Bones scraped up by Yavapai tribal elders and archaeologists (accompanied by deputy sheriff)
- Fragments recovered into 1930s
- **Memorial Day 1985**: Service at Fort McDowell Presbyterian Church, tombstone dedicated over mass grave
- Norman Austin (Fort McDowell tribal president 1985): "The record has never been set straight... the victims were Yavapais, not Apaches."

### Broader Impact

The survivors of the massacre and the wider Yavapai War were eventually forced onto reservations. Three months after Skeleton Cave, the dispirited Yavapai tribe surrendered to U.S. Forces at Camp Verde (April 27, 1873). The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation is composed of the descendants of these survivors.

### Known Survivors

**Mike Burns (Hoomothya)**: The primary witness and survivor who left a detailed account of the massacre. He was captured six days before the attack and forced to witness the slaughter of his family and people.

**Dr. Carlos Montezuma**: Found as a small baby nearly suffocated under the body of his dead mother. He was adopted by a Maricopa woman and later taken in by a wealthy easterner. He was educated and became a medical doctor and outspoken leader for Indian rights. Montezuma was Mike Burns's cousin. [CHECK: Verify relationship and whether Montezuma left any account of the massacre]

## Military Documentation

The Battle at Skeleton Cave was documented in multiple official sources:

- **Official Cavalry Reports**: Army reports indicated 75 "hostiles" killed and 25 captured, though later records show 76 deaths
- **John Gregory Bourke's Diary**: Lieutenant Bourke kept detailed daily journals beginning in November 1872, documenting the massacre with vivid eyewitness details. His 124 manuscript volumes are held at the United States Military Academy Library at West Point and are considered invaluable primary sources by Western historians
- **Captain James Burns's Records**: Captain Burns documented the events in his official reports
- **General George Crook's Reports**: Lieutenant Colonel Crook filed official accounts of the operation

**Operational Context**: Skeleton Cave was one of seven actions against the Apaches and Yavapais during December 1872. In that 31-day period, 106 Native Americans were killed across all engagements.

## Legacy

The Skeleton Cave Massacre stands as a stark reminder of the brutality of the Indian Wars. The event was largely forgotten by the wider American public for many years, but it has been preserved in the oral traditions of the Yavapai people and in the written account of its only living survivor, Mike Burns.

His autobiography, "The Only One Living to Tell," provides a harrowing and essential firsthand account of the massacre, ensuring that the story of what happened at Skeleton Cave is not lost to history.
