# The Skeleton Cave Massacre

**The Skeleton Cave Massacre**, also known as the **Battle of Salt River Canyon**, was a tragic and brutal event that took place on **December 28, 1872**, in the Salt River Canyon of Arizona. It was a pivotal moment in the Yavapai War and a dark chapter in the history of the American West.

## Background and Location

The massacre occurred during the 1872 Tonto Basin Campaign, a major military operation by the U.S. Army aimed at removing the Yavapai and Apache people from their ancestral lands and forcing them onto reservations.

### Geographic Details of Skeleton Cave
The cave is located on the northern wall of the Salt River Canyon near present-day Horse Mesa Dam in Maricopa County, Arizona, hidden in the cliffs between Canyon Lake and Apache Lake.

**Physical Description**:
- A rock shelter formed by an overhang in the cliff wall
- Approximately **118 feet (36 m) wide** and **no deeper than 40 feet (12 m)**
- An elliptical undercut measuring about **65 by 25 feet**
- Sits **1,200 feet (370 m) above the river** at the base of a **170 feet (52 m) cliff**

**Terrain Access**: The cave lies on the canyon's north rim at the angle of a sharp turn to the south. Above the cave is a mesa/plateau from which a trail descends down the cliff face to the cave entrance. The soldiers positioned themselves on this mesa above the rim, then descended to attack.

**Sun Position (Winter)**: Being on the north rim, the cave remains in shadow for much of the winter day, especially in early morning. The south rim across the canyon catches the first sunlight at dawn, while the north rim stays shaded. This tactical disadvantage aided the soldiers' dawn approach.

**Climate (December)**: Winter in central Arizona can bring cold air masses from Canada, with temperatures dropping below freezing at night. The area experiences occasional Pacific storms during winter months (November-March). [CHECK: Specific weather conditions on December 28, 1872]

## The Parties Involved

*   **The Yavapai:** A band of Yavapai people, including men, women, and children, were seeking shelter in the cave. They were led by the chief Nanni-chaddi.

*   **The U.S. Army:** The soldiers were from the 5th U.S. Cavalry, under the overall command of General George Crook. The troops directly involved in the attack were led by Captain William H. Brown. Captain James Burns and his Company G were also a key part of the operation.

*   **Native American Scouts:** The U.S. Army was aided by approximately 30 Apache and Pima scouts, who used their knowledge of the terrain to locate the Yavapai.

## The Events Leading to the Massacre

On December 22, 1872, Captain James Burns captured a young Yavapai boy named **Hoomothya** (who would later be known as Mike Burns). The boy was captured on the mesa/plateau above the canyon rim while gathering firewood. For six days, the boy was held captive as the soldiers positioned themselves for the attack.

## The Attack

### Tactical Approach
The troops began their final approach at **8:00 PM on December 27**, using stealth tactics learned from their scouts. They wore moccasins stuffed with dry grass instead of heavy cavalry boots to move silently. They reached the mesa above the canyon rim **4Â¼ hours later** (around 12:15 AM), and Apache scouts reported seeing fires in the cave far below about **2:00 AM on December 28**. The soldiers camped on the mesa throughout the night, positioned above the cave on the north rim.

### Dawn Assault
At dawn on December 28, the soldiers and scouts descended from the mesa to positions around the cave. The north rim remained in shadow while the south rim across the canyon caught the first light, giving the soldiers cover in darkness as they positioned themselves. Inside, the Yavapai were celebrating a recent successful raid with dancing. When Captain Brown's men called for surrender, according to John Bourke's diary, "The only answer was a shriek of hatred and defiance" and threats from the Yavapai.

Soldiers opened fire on the men, women, and children. Some of Brown's men aimed for the cave roof, causing bullets to ricochet off the stone ceiling into the people below. In a particularly brutal tactic, soldiers positioned on the mesa above also rolled large boulders down from the rim, crushing those seeking shelter at the cave entrance.

**John Bourke's Account**: Bourke documented a particularly haunting moment in his diary: "At one point in the battle, a 4-year old boy ran to the mouth of the cave 'and stood thumb in mouth, looking in speechless wonder and indignation at the belching barrels.'"

The Yavapai were trapped and outgunned, and the attack quickly turned into a massacre.

## Casualties and Aftermath

Estimates of the number of Yavapai killed in the Skeleton Cave Massacre vary. U.S. Army records indicate 76 dead, while other accounts place the number as high as 128. Mike Burns himself recalled that around 225 people were in the cave.

The bodies of the victims were left in the cave, which is how it earned its name. The remains were not discovered by outsiders until 1905. The bones were later collected and moved, first to Fort McDowell and then to the San Carlos Apache Reservation, and finally, in 1988, to the Arizona State Hospital Cemetery in Phoenix.

The survivors of the massacre and the wider Yavapai War were eventually forced onto the San Carlos Apache Reservation. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation is composed of the descendants of these survivors.

### Known Survivors

**Mike Burns (Hoomothya)**: The primary witness and survivor who left a detailed account of the massacre. He was captured six days before the attack and forced to witness the slaughter of his family and people.

**Dr. Carlos Montezuma**: Found as a small baby nearly suffocated under the body of his dead mother. He was adopted by a Maricopa woman and later taken in by a wealthy easterner. He was educated and became a medical doctor and outspoken leader for Indian rights. Montezuma was Mike Burns's cousin.

## Military Documentation

The Battle at Skeleton Cave was documented in multiple official sources:

- **Official Cavalry Reports**: Army reports indicated 75 "hostiles" killed and 25 captured, though later records show 76 deaths
- **John Gregory Bourke's Diary**: Lieutenant Bourke kept detailed daily journals beginning in November 1872, documenting the massacre with vivid eyewitness details. His 124 manuscript volumes are held at the United States Military Academy Library at West Point and are considered invaluable primary sources by Western historians
- **Captain James Burns's Records**: Captain Burns documented the events in his official reports
- **General George Crook's Reports**: Lieutenant Colonel Crook filed official accounts of the operation

**Operational Context**: Skeleton Cave was one of seven actions against the Apaches and Yavapais during December 1872. In that 31-day period, 106 Native Americans were killed across all engagements.

## Legacy

The Skeleton Cave Massacre stands as a stark reminder of the brutality of the Indian Wars. The event was largely forgotten by the wider American public for many years, but it has been preserved in the oral traditions of the Yavapai people and in the written account of its only living survivor, Mike Burns.

His autobiography, "The Only One Living to Tell," provides a harrowing and essential firsthand account of the massacre, ensuring that the story of what happened at Skeleton Cave is not lost to history.
