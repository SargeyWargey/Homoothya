## PROLOGUE: The Witness ðŸŸ¡ MIKE PRESENT

**Word Count**: ~1,750 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns, 1934)
**Location**: Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona
**Time**: May 1934
**POV Note**: **REVISED** - Mike does NOT mention the boy or Hoomothya at all

**Key Events**:
- Mike, age 69, sits down to write his testimony
- Establishes dual mission: his own story AND his people's story
- "I am the only one living to tell"
- References the massacre obliquely, what was lost, what must be remembered
- Urgency: knows he's dying, must finish before time runs out
- Reflects on 24 years of trying to publish this story
- "The White People have heard only one side"

**Summary**:
An elderly Mike Burns at Fort McDowell begins writing in May 1934, knowing death is near. He establishes his dual mission: to tell his own history and to tell the broader story of his peopleâ€”what the Yavapai endured, what was taken, what truth has been hidden. He reflects on being the sole survivor of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, on twenty-four years of writing and rejection, on the weight of carrying these stories alone. The tone is elegiac, determined, urgent. He speaks of the dead who deserve witness, the truth that must be recorded before he dies, and his determination to tell "the other side" that history has silenced. No mention of childhood or the name Hoomothyaâ€”only the present moment: an old man with a pencil, dual stories to tell, and limited time.

**Content from existing draft**: Revise current Prologue to:
- Remove all mentions of "the boy" or "Hoomothya"
- Focus entirely on Mike's present moment (1934)
- Establish witness mission and urgency
- No flashbacks, no references to childhood identity

## ACT I: TWO LIVES (Chapters 1-13)

### CHAPTER 1: The Education ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns, adult reflecting)
**Location**: Fort McDowell 1934 (primary); brief references to Carlisle
**Time**: 1934 (present); brief mentions of 1880-1885

**Key Events**:
- Mike reflects on his education and what it cost
- Acknowledges he learned to read and write English
- The bitter exchange: culture taken, literacy given
- Unique position: one of few Yavapai who can write English
- This makes it his responsibility to tell the story
- Burden and duty: if he doesn't tell this, who will?
- Native perspective must be recorded before it's lost

**Summary**:
Mike Burns, writing in 1934, reflects briefly on his educationâ€”he was sent to Carlisle, learned to read and write English, paid a high price for that literacy. He doesn't dwell on the details of boarding school; that's not the point. The point is this: he received an education, and with it came capability and responsibility. He is one of very few Yavapai who can write in the language white people read. If he doesn't tell the story of his people's experiences from the Native perspective, who will? The burden is his. The duty is his. This education, forced upon him, has made him uniquely qualified to be the witness. The reader meets adult Mike's voice: clear, purposeful, aware of his mission.

**New content needed**: Draft this chapter fresh, keeping focus tight on education's outcome and Mike's responsibility.

Third-person narration shows his world through child's sensory experienceâ€”grandmother's patient teaching, mother's songs, the weight of the burden basket, the taste of sweet pods. His uncle and father return from hunting. The family gathers around fires. Everything is as it should be. This chapter establishes Hoomothya's innocence and the richness of Yavapai lifeâ€”the world that will be destroyed. No references to "Mike Burns" exist here.

### CHAPTER 3: The Witness's Burden ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words

- Questioning whether anyone will publish this

**Summary**:
In 1934, Mike sits at his writing table and confronts the hardest part: writing about the massacre. His hands shake. He references his guilt about "leading the soldiers there" without explaining what that means yet. He speaks of being the sole survivor, the only witness. He's written to publishers for 24 years with no success. But he'll write it anywayâ€”the dead deserve witness. The chapter deepens Mike's character: survivor guilt, mission-driven, isolated. Readers wonder: how does he know these details? Was he there?

**New content needed**: Draft fresh, establishing Mike's relationship to the massacre without revealing he's Hoomothya yet.

**Summary**:
Hoomothya goes hunting with his uncle before dawn. Third-person narrative shows the boy learning to trackâ€”reading deer prints, following signs, moving quietly. His uncle shoots a deer and teaches him to thank the animal's spirit. Hoomothya helps with field dressing, understanding the cost of food. He carries his uncle's bow back to campâ€”pride and responsibility. That night the whole band eats deer meat, sharing the kill. The chapter shows traditional education and the skills Hoomothya is learningâ€”skills he'll later use tragically as an Army scout.

- "I lived in two worlds, at home in neither"
- Encounter where he tracked his own people

**Summary**:
Mike Burns recounts his Army scout service (1885-1888) in first-person retrospective. He describes tracking Native peoples for the soldiers, the moral compromise required for survival. He admits to tracking Yavapai specificallyâ€”his own peopleâ€”and the devastating guilt that followed. He explains he had nowhere else to go, no other way to survive. The education at Carlisle had made him too "American" for his people, but he was never accepted as equal by whites. He belonged nowhere. The chapter deepens his character: complex, morally compromised, haunted.

**New content needed**: Draft fresh, showing Mike's scout service and his "between-worlds" isolation.

The third-person narrative shows Hoomothya remembering his first mother's deathâ€”killed by soldiers near Mormon Flat while gathering agave. His father changed after that, became hard and vengeful. Now the family must flee. The adults decide to seek refuge in the cave in Salt River Canyon. They pack only what they can carry, bury grinding stones, leave their camp behind. Hoomothya doesn't understand fully, but he feels the fear.

### CHAPTER 7: The First Voter ðŸŸ¡ MIKE PRESENT

**Summary**:
Mike Burns recounts his historic voter registration in 1908â€”the first Native American registered in Arizona Territory. In first-person, he describes walking to the Prescott office, facing the registrar's surprise, signing the papers. The Burke Act required him to prove "competency" and sever tribal relations on paper. The bitter irony: he gained American citizenship by officially renouncing being Yavapai. He voted for Judge Wells, "a friend," asserting political voice while feeling the cost. The chapter shows Mike's lifelong struggle with identityâ€”claiming rights while losing self.

**New content needed**: Draft fresh, based on historical event (July 14, 1908).

**Summary**:

They reach Salt River Canyon's rim and must descend the cliff faceâ€”a terrifying climb where Hoomothya nearly falls. They cross the sharp lava bed, then climb the final slope to the cave mouth. Inside, 76 people settle into the cramped space. From the cave entrance, Hoomothya can see the whole approachâ€”they'll spot anyone coming from miles away. But the cave is also a trap. The chapter ends with Hoomothya dreaming of soldiers climbing toward them.

- Decision: tell it all, no matter the cost
- "The boy deserves his story told"

**Summary**:
In 1934 at Fort McDowell, Mike sits at his table preparing to write the massacre scene. His hands shake. His head aches. He questions whether he can do thisâ€”relive that horror, put it into words. He speaks of "the boy" who witnessed it, creating continued mystery (readers don't yet know Mike IS that boy). He acknowledges writing about trauma is its own form of suffering, but he must do it. The dead deserve witness. "The boy" deserves to have his story told. Mike's determination overcomes his pain. This interlude prepares readers for the coming horror and deepens Mike's character as witness-bearer.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”interlude showing Mike's emotional struggle with approaching the massacre.

**Narrative Voice**: Third-person limited (Hoomothya)
**Location**: Near Skeleton Cave, Salt River Canyon
**Time**: December 22, 1872 (six days before massacre)
**Age**: Hoomothya 7-8 years old

**Key Events**:
- Hoomothya captured by Captain James Burns and soldiers
- Terrified, doesn't speak English, doesn't understand
- Taken prisoner, bound, separated from family
- First night in soldier camp: cold, scared, alone
- **CRITICAL**: This is the capture that leads to the massacre

**Summary**:
Six days before the massacre, Hoomothya is captured by Captain James Burns and 5th Cavalry soldiers. The third-person narrative shows his terror: strange white men speaking incomprehensible language, rough hands grabbing him, being bound and taken. He cries for his mother. The soldiers ignore him or laugh. That first night in the soldier camp is freezing and terrifyingâ€”he doesn't know if they'll kill him, doesn't understand what they want. The boy has no idea his capture will lead them to his family. This chapter is heartbreaking and sets up the coming catastrophe.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the capture scene that Mike Burns testified about.

### CHAPTER 11: The Letter to Sharlot Hall ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns)

**Time**: January 6, 1910; 1934 reflections

**Key Events**:
- Mike writes letter to Sharlot Hall seeking publication help
- His exact words: "a little history of the Apaches... including my own history"
- "I am going to tell the White People that they have heard only one side"
- Hall is kind but publishers won't touch the story
- Mike's mission crystalizes: tell truth regardless of audience

**Summary**:
Mike Burns recounts writing to territorial historian Sharlot Hall on January 6, 1910, seeking help to publish his story. In first-person, he describes composing the humble letter, his hope that someone might listen. He uses his actual historical words: asking for "a little history... including my own history," saying he wants to tell "the other side" of the Apache Wars. Hall responds kindly but can't find publishersâ€”no one wants an Indian's version of events, especially one that contradicts the heroic narrative. Mike describes the rejection but also his realization: he'll write it anyway. Truth matters more than audience. This chapter shows Mike's persistence and mission.

**New content needed**: Draft fresh, based on historical January 6, 1910 letter.

### CHAPTER 12: Six Days ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person limited (Hoomothya)
**Location**: Soldier camp, moving toward Salt River Canyon

**Key Events**:
- Hoomothya held captive for six days
- Forced to travel with soldiers
- Doesn't know where they're going
- Realizes they're moving toward his family's area
- Growing horror: is he leading them to the cave?
- December 27 night: the night before the massacre

**Summary**:
For six days, Hoomothya is dragged along with the soldiers. Third-person narrative shows his confusion, fear, and dawning horror. He doesn't speak English, can't understand their plans. But he recognizes landmarksâ€”they're moving toward Salt River Canyon, toward his family. Did he somehow reveal where they are? The guilt begins forming even though he's just a terrified child. The soldiers prepare for something. On the night of December 27, Hoomothya realizes they're close to the cave. He tries to warn his family somehow but can't. The chapter ends the night before the massacre, dread building to unbearable levels.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the psychological torture of the six-day captivity.

### CHAPTER 13: December 28, 1872 ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA + ðŸŸ¢ THE REVEAL

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person (Hoomothya) â†’ shifts to First-person (Mike) at THE REVEAL
**Location**: Skeleton Cave, Salt River Canyon
**Time**: December 28, 1872 (the massacre)
**Age**: Hoomothya 7-8 years old

**Key Events**:
- The Skeleton Cave Massacre unfolds
- Hoomothya forced to lead soldiers to the cave (or watches helplessly)
- 76 Yavapai killed: women, children, elders
- Gunfire, boulders, screams, silence
- Hoomothya survivesâ€”the only one
- **THE REVEAL**: Mike's voice interrupts: "That boy was me."

**Summary**:
December 28, 1872. Dawn. Third-person narrative follows Hoomothya as the soldiers reach the cave. Whether he's forced to lead them or simply witnesses from captivity, the horror unfolds: gunfire echoing in the cave, boulders rolled onto the entrance, screams that stop too soon, terrible silence. Hoomothya sees his family die. His mother. His father. His grandmother. Nashta. Everyone. 76 people slaughtered. The third-person narration shows fragmentsâ€”a child's traumatized, dissociated experience.

**THE REVEAL** (final paragraphs):
The narration shifts. Mike's first-person voice breaks through:
"I am that boy. I am Hoomothya. I am the only one living to tell. I watched my family die, and I carry their names, and I have lived sixty-two years with this weight. Now you know. The boy whose story I've been tellingâ€”that boy was me."

**READER IMPACT**: Shock. Grief. Reinterpretation of everything. Mike's guilt, his education, his witness missionâ€”all make devastating sense now.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the most important chapter, requiring extreme cultural sensitivity and restraint.

---

## ACT II: THE SPLIT SELF (Chapters 14-24)

**Post-reveal note**: Reader now knows Mike = Hoomothya. Both narrative streams continue, but with new understanding. Hoomothya chapters are Mike's traumatic memories he still can't claim as "I." Mike chapters are his adult life trying to survive the identity split.

### CHAPTER 14: Among the Dead ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person (continues post-revealâ€”Mike still can't say "I" about this)
**Location**: Skeleton Cave, immediately after massacre
**Time**: December 28, 1872, afternoon
**Age**: Hoomothya 7-8 years old

**Key Events**:
- Aftermath: Hoomothya alone among the bodies
- Soldiers leaving, cleanup
- Captain Burns takes the boy
- Hoomothya too shocked to resist or understand
- Beginning of forced "adoption"

**Summary**:
The massacre is over. Silence. Hoomothya stands among the deadâ€”his mother, father, grandmother, Nashta, everyone he loved. The third-person narration (now understood as Mike's dissociated memory) shows the boy in shock, unable to fully process. Captain Burns approaches and takes him. The man who led this slaughter now takes the lone survivor. Hoomothya is too numb to resist. He's led away from the cave, leaving his family's bodies behind. The chapter is brief but devastatingâ€”the moment of total loss, the beginning of his new life as a captive.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the immediate aftermath, the moment Burns takes him.

---

### CHAPTER 15: The Renaming ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person (Hoomothya memory)
**Location**: With Captain Burns, Arizona Territory
**Time**: Late December 1872-early 1873
**Age**: Hoomothya 7-8 years old

**Key Events**:
- Captain Burns gives him a new name: "Mike Burns"
- Hoomothya doesn't understand at first
- Learning to answer to the new name
- Symbolic death of Yavapai identity
- Forced assimilation begins

**Summary**:
Shortly after the massacre, Captain Burns tells the traumatized child: "Your name is Mike Burns now." The third-person narrative shows Hoomothya's confusionâ€”the sounds mean nothing. But Burns repeats it, teaches him to answer when called "Mike." The Yavapai name "Hoomothya" is forbidden or simply erased. The boy learns to respond to "Mike Burns" because he has no choice. This chapter shows the beginning of identity erasureâ€”the death of Hoomothya and the forced creation of Mike Burns. Post-reveal, readers understand this as Mike's traumatic memory of losing his name and self.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the symbolic moment of renaming.

---

### CHAPTER 16: Life with the Killer ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns, adult)
**Location**: Living with Captain Burns, 1872-1880; Fort McDowell 1934 frame
**Time**: 1872-1880 (childhood with Burns); 1934 reflections

**Key Events**:
- Mike reflects on years living with Captain Burns
- The impossible bond: killer and adoptive father
- Moments of kindness vs. hatred
- Learning English, "American ways"
- "He destroyed my family and he raised meâ€”both are true"

**Summary**:
Mike Burns, writing in 1934, reflects on the eight years (1872-1880) he spent living with Captain James Burnsâ€”the man who led his capture and was present at the massacre. In first-person, Mike describes the impossible contradiction: hating Burns for what he did, needing him for survival, even feeling occasional gratitude for acts of kindness. Burns taught him English, fed him, clothed him, and in his way, cared for him. Mike learned to navigate this moral complexity. He couldn't reconcile it then and can't now. He simply states both truths: Burns killed his family, and Burns raised him. This chapter shows Mike's lifelong struggle with moral ambiguity and complicated feelings.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the complex Burns relationship from adult Mike's perspective.

### CHAPTER 17: The Transformation Ceremony ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA (memory)

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person (memory from Mike's Carlisle arrival)
**Location**: Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania
**Time**: September 1880 (arrival)
**Age**: Mike Burns (formerly Hoomothya) age 15

**Key Events**:
- Arrival at Carlisle (September 1880)
- Hair cutting ceremonyâ€”cultural violation
- Issued uniforms, forbidden from speaking Yavapai
- "Kill the Indian, save the man" made real
- Hoomothya dies again symbolically

**Summary**:
Mike's memory of arriving at Carlisle in September 1880, told in third-person as traumatic flashback. The boy who became Mike Burns (age 15) experiences the "transformation ceremony"â€”hair cutting, uniform issued, English-only rule enforced. Superintendent Pratt's "Kill the Indian, save the man" philosophy is made brutally literal. Everything Yavapai is stripped away. Mike Burns the American student is created through violent erasure. Post-reveal, readers understand this as Mike reliving the moment Hoomothya died for the second time. The first death was in the cave; the second was at Carlisle.

**New content needed**: Draft fresh, though can incorporate material from Chapter 1 (Mike) perspective.

### CHAPTER 18: Writing Forty-Two Years Later ðŸŸ¡ MIKE PRESENT

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns, 1934)
**Location**: Fort McDowell, 1934
**Time**: June 1934

**Key Events**:
- Mike writing 42 years after the massacre (1872-1934)
- Processing trauma through writing
- "I couldn't speak of the boy as 'I'â€”he felt like someone else"
- Understanding why he needed third-person distance
- Determination to continue despite pain

**Summary**:
Mike Burns, writing in June 1934, reflects on the process of telling his story 42 years after the massacre. He explains why he wrote about "the boy" Hoomothya in third person before the revealâ€”that traumatized child felt like someone else, someone he loved and lost, not himself. He couldn't claim those memories as "I" because Hoomothya died in that cave. Only Mike Burns survived. Writing about the massacre is forcing him to integrate those split selves, but it's agonizing. Still, he continues. The chapter is meta-textual and emotional, showing Mike's awareness of his fractured identity and his attempts at healing through testimony.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”Mike reflecting on his own writing process and identity split.

### CHAPTER 19: The Scout's Betrayal ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns)
**Location**: Arizona Territory, Army scout missions, 1885-1888
**Time**: 1885-1888 (scout service)

**Key Events**:
- Mike tracking Apache and Yavapai for Army
- Specific mission: tracking Yavapai band
- Face-to-face with Yavapai he's helping hunt
- Their recognition: he's one of them, now a traitor
- Mike's unbearable guilt

**Summary**:
Mike Burns recounts his worst scout service memory in first-person: the day he tracked a Yavapai band. He found their trail, led soldiers to them, watched them captured or killed. One Yavapai man recognized himâ€”saw Mike's face and knew he was Kwevkepaya, one of them. The look of betrayal and contempt haunts Mike to this day. He was using the tracking skills his uncle taught him to hunt his own people. The ultimate betrayal of everything Hoomothya was. Mike doesn't excuse it, doesn't ask for forgiveness. He simply tells it: this is what I did to survive. This is the cost of Mike Burns's existence. The chapter is devastating and shows Mike's moral courage in confessing.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”the specific incident of tracking Yavapai.

### CHAPTER 20: The Classroom ðŸ”´ HOOMOTHYA (memory)

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: Third-person (memory from Carlisle)
**Location**: Carlisle Indian School classroom
**Time**: 1880-1885 (Carlisle years)
**Age**: 15-20 years old

**Key Events**:
- Learning to read and write English
- Teacher's kindness and cruelty mixed
- Forbidden to speak Yavapaiâ€”punished when caught
- Secret resistance: whispering native language at night
- The moment literacy clickedâ€”power and loss

**Summary**:
A memory from Carlisle told in third-person: Mike Burns learning to write. The classroom scenes show the complexityâ€”some teachers were cruel, some unexpectedly kind. English literacy was both weapon and tool. The boy who became Mike mastered it, understanding that education was survival. But Yavapai language was forbidden. Students whispered it in dormitories at night, risking punishment to maintain connection to who they'd been. The chapter shows the double-edged nature of assimilation: Mike gained skills to witness, but lost language and culture in exchange. Post-reveal, readers see this as young Mike caught between worlds.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”specific Carlisle classroom memories.

### CHAPTER 21: Discharge ðŸ”µ MIKE

**Word Count**: ~2,500 words
**Narrative Voice**: First-person (Mike Burns)
**Location**: Military post, Arizona Territory (1888 discharge); Fort McDowell 1934
**Time**: December 1888 (discharge); 1934 reflections

**Key Events**:
- Mike's discharge from Army scout service (December 1888)
- Age 23, nowhere to go
- Neither Yavapai nor whiteâ€”belonging nowhere
- Return to Arizona, seeking Yavapai community
- Rejection or complicated acceptance from survivors

**Summary**:
Mike Burns recounts his December 1888 discharge from the Army in first-person. At age 23, he turned in his uniform and weapons, received final pay, and faced uncertainty: where did he belong? He returned to Arizona seeking Yavapai survivors. Some accepted him; others saw him as traitor for his scout service. Whites saw him as "civilized Indian" but never equal. Mike describes this as the pinnacle of belonging nowhereâ€”too Yavapai for whites, too assimilated for Yavapai, too compromised to fit anywhere. The education and scout service that kept him alive also ensured he'd never have a home. This chapter deepens the "neither/both" theme.

**New content needed**: Draft freshâ€”discharge and return to Arizona, seeking belonging.

A memory from Mike's one year at Highland University (1885-1886), told in third-person. The young man Mike Burns (age 20) experiences this brief period of higher education in Kansas. It's different from Carlisleâ€”less overtly oppressiveâ€”but he's still displaced, still "the Indian student," still between worlds. The chapter explores why this year mattered and why it ended. Was it financial? Social isolation? The decision to enlist as Army scout instead? The memory shows Mike's continued search for belonging and purpose during this sparsely-documented year.

In first-person, he describes trying to build a normal life: work, possibly marriage, living on or near reservations. But he was haunted. The massacre. His family. The sole survivor guilt. Slowly, the realization grew: he must write it down. Must tell what happened. Witnessing became his purpose. This chapter fills the gap between scout service and his 1908 voter registration, showing Mike's gradual transformation from survivor trying to forget to witness determined to remember.

Mike Burns, writing in July 1934, reflects on twenty-four years of persistence (1910-1934). He's written draft after draft, sent letters to publishers, received rejection after rejection. No one wants an Indian's story. No one wants to hear that American heroes committed atrocities. But Mike kept writing. The dead deserve witness. The truth deserves telling. Even if his manuscript sits in a drawer forever, he will have done his duty. He writes for the seventy-six who died in Skeleton Cave, for his mother and father and grandmother and Nashta. Not for fame or publicationâ€”for them. This chapter shows Mike's transcendent purpose and sets up Act III.
