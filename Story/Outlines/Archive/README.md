# Archive - Obsolete Outlines

## Purpose
This folder contains previous outline versions that have been superseded by **Chronological_Outline_v2.md**.

## Archived Files
- `Chapter_by_Chapter_Outline.md` - Original chapter outline
- `Dual_Narrative_Chapter_by_Chapter_Outline.md` - Dual narrative structure (abandoned)
- `Chronological_Outline.md` - First chronological version
- `Master_Scene_Plan.md` - Original scene planning document
- `Master_Outline_Events_People_Places.md` - Research/development outline

## Current Definitive Outline
**`/Story/Outlines/Chronological_Outline_v2.md`**

This is the ONLY outline to follow for writing new chapters.

## Why Archived
These outlines represented earlier structural approaches that have been revised. The v2 outline introduces a crucial narrative innovation:
- Mystery structure (readers don't know Mike = Hoomothya until Chapter 21)
- First-person Mike narrative (Act I)
- Third-person Hoomothya manuscript (Act II)
- The dramatic reveal (Chapter 21)
- Post-reveal publication journey (Act III)

## Status
- Reference only
- Do not update
- All new planning should align with v2 outline
