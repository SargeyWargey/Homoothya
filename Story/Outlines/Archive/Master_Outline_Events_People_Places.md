## EVENTS

### Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)
**Synopsis**: The most tragic event in Yavapai history. Mike Burns (age ~7-8) was forced to witness the massacre of approximately 225 Yavapai people—including his father, grandfather, younger brother, baby sister, aunt with 5 children, and uncle—in a cave on the north side of Salt River at the mouth of Fish Creek. US soldiers used ricochet fire, bouncing bullets off cave walls to slaughter people sheltered inside. After the shooting stopped, Pima and Maricopa scouts crushed the heads of wounded survivors with rocks. Mike Burns is "the only one living to tell" this story.

**Key Dates**: December 28, 1872

**Sources**:
- Mike Burns's eyewitness testimony (PRIMARY - AUTHORITATIVE)
- APCRP article (secondary - reports 54-76 casualties vs. Mike's ~225)

**Contradictions**: Casualty counts differ significantly. **Mike's account is authoritative as eyewitness.**

### Mike Burns Capture (December 22, 1872)
**Synopsis**: Six days before the massacre, seven-year-old Hoomothya (Mike Burns) was sent with his uncle to Wipuk (Sedona area) to retrieve a horse. When soldiers appeared, his uncle deserted him. The terrified child hid in a rock hole all night during a snowstorm, wearing only a G-string, and nearly froze to death at ~7,645 feet elevation near Four Peaks. The next morning, he emerged and was captured by soldiers and taken to Captain James Burns.

### Rio Verde Reservation Period (1873-1875)
**Synopsis**: After the winter campaign ended, General Crook gathered all Yavapai and Tonto Apaches at Camp Verde/Cottonwood—approximately 3,500 people—and moved them to Rio Verde Agency. Crook promised they could stay "as long as they lived." For about two years, they lived peacefully, raised crops (wheat, barley, corn), and received daily rations. However, a disease outbreak killed approximately 1,500 people; the Yavapai believed Dr. Josephus Williams poisoned them. There were also conflicts between Tontos and Apache Mojaves/Yumas. In February 1875, Crook broke his promise.

**Key Dates**: 1873-1875

### March of Tears / Forced Relocation to San Carlos (February 1875)
**Synopsis**: In the latter part of February 1875, General Crook broke his promise that the Yavapai could stay at Rio Verde "as long as they lived." Approximately 2,000 Indians were forced to march from Rio Verde to San Carlos—a toilsome 20-day journey. Rations ran short. On the East Verde River, a conflict erupted between Tontos and Apache Yumas/Mojaves, resulting in 30-35 Tontos killed. Al Sieber was shot through the stomach and became lame for life. When they arrived at San Carlos, they were "thrown among a lot of people they did not know." Crook said they could return in 5-7 years—a promise never kept.

## CONTRADICTIONS REQUIRING RESOLUTION

### Critical Contradictions (Mike Burns is Authoritative)

1. **Skeleton Cave Casualty Count**: Mike says ~225; APCRP says 54-76. **Mike's eyewitness account is authoritative.**

2. **Who Led Skeleton Cave Attack**: Mike says Captain James Burns; APCRP says Captain William H. Brown. **Need research—possibly both present. Mike's version authoritative for his experience.**

3. **Was Chief Delshe at Skeleton Cave?**: Mike says YES, killed there; APCRP says NO, surrendered later. **Mike's eyewitness account is authoritative—Delshe WAS there and WAS killed.**

4. **Mike's Death Date**: APCRP says November 16, 1934; Mike's manuscript says November 26, 1934. **Need to verify, but manuscript likely correct.**

5. **Highland University Location**: APCRP says New Mexico; Mike says Kansas. **Mike is CORRECT—Highland, Kansas.**

6. **Duration of Scout Service**: APCRP says "30 years" after Captain Burns died 1874; Mike says intermittent service mostly 1885-1887. **Mike is CORRECT—APCRP conflates different periods.**
