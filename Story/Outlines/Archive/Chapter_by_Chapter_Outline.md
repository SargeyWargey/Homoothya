# Chapter-by-Chapter Outline: The Life of Mike Burns (Hoomothya)

**Novel Structure**: Prologue + 34 Chapters + Epilogue = 87,500 words
**Target**: ~2,500 words per chapter

---

## CRITICAL NARRATIVE DEVICE: IDENTITY REVEAL STRUCTURE

**Key Decision**: The Prologue is narrated by Mike Burns (1934), but does NOT reveal the name "Hoomothya" to readers.

**Narrative Strategy**:
- **Prologue**: Mike Burns speaks in first person, hints at "another name, a Yavapai name" that the boy had before
- **Act I Chapters 1-12**: Story told about "a boy" or using the name Hoomothya, as if this is a different character from Mike
- **Identity Reveal Moment** (TBD - likely Chapter 12-13): Reader discovers that Hoomothya and Mike Burns are the same person
- **Effect**: Creates dramatic irony, deepens impact of name erasure, emphasizes the split identity Mike lives with

**Writing Approach**:
- Prologue avoids saying "I was Hoomothya" - instead: "There was a boy once. He had another name, a Yavapai name..."
- Act I written as Mike remembering the boy he was, maintaining slight narrative distance
- Transition should feel like Mike IS the boy, but readers don't realize connection until reveal
- Name "Hoomothya" appears in chapter titles and narration, but connection to Mike not explicit until key moment

**Purpose**: Honors the erasure Mike experienced by making readers experience the disconnect between his two identities, then the shock of realizing they're one person split apart.

## WRITING APPROACH FOR EACH CHAPTER

For every chapter, remember:

1. **Start in motion**: Action, dialogue, sensory moment—not exposition
2. **Live in Mike's skin**: First-person intimate, immediate, not historical
3. **Specific over general**: Details that make scenes breathe
4. **Emotional truth first**: What does this FEEL like?
5. **Show don't tell**: Action, dialogue, thought—not summary
6. **End with pull**: Tension, question, emotion drawing reader forward

**This is a NOVEL**: Research serves the story. Make readers FEEL Mike's journey. Honor his witness through powerful storytelling.
