## KEY STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS

### The Two Narratives
1. **Mike's Life** (Act I): First-person, chronological, post-capture to old age
2. **Hoomothya's Story** (Act II): Third-person manuscript Mike writes about his childhood

### The Reveal
- **Act I End (Chapter 12)**: Mike reveals he IS Hoomothya—the boy in the manuscript he's about to write
- **Impact**: Readers reinterpret everything—guilt, survival, witness mission all devastatingly clear

### The Manuscript-Within-Novel
- Act II chapters are Mike's manuscript pages
- He writes about himself in third person because he can't claim Hoomothya as "I"
- Dissociation made literary device
- Integration happens through writing

### Emotional Arc
1. **Act I**: Survival, adaptation, guilt, seeking purpose
2. **Act II**: Reclaiming lost self through writing, integration through witness
3. **Act III**: Mission persistence, completion, death, posthumous vindication

## CONTENT FROM EXISTING DRAFTS

**To Convert/Preserve** (third-person where needed):
- Current Prologue → Revise for new structure
- Current Chapter 1 (Mesquite) → Act II Chapter 14
- Current Chapter 2 (Lessons) → Act II Chapter 15
- Current Chapter 3 (Whispers) → Act II Chapter 17
- Current Chapter 4 (Climb) → Act II Chapter 18

**To Create Fresh**:
- All Act I chapters (Mike's life chronologically)
- Act II Chapters 13, 16, 19-24 (manuscript sections)
- All Act III chapters (publication journey)
- Epilogue (posthumous success)

---

## WRITING PRINCIPLES

1. **Act I** - First-person intimate, Mike's voice clear and unflinching
2. **Act II** - Third-person close, Hoomothya through Mike's loving/distanced gaze
3. **Act III** - First-person return, then omniscient for publication journey
4. **Throughout** - Specific over general, sensory immersion, emotional truth first
5. **Always** - Honor the witness, respect the dead, cultural consultation mandatory

---

**This structure creates**:
1. Chronological clarity (Mike's life unfolds logically)
2. Emotional power (the reveal recontextualizes everything)
3. Literary innovation (manuscript-within-novel mirrors Mike's dissociation)
4. Satisfying arc (survival → witness → completion → vindication)
5. Deep character study (Mike Burns as full human being across 69 years)

**Ready to begin restructuring existing chapters and drafting new content following this roadmap.**
