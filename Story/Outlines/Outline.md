- **Epilogue**: Present day, legacy affirmed

## THE REVEAL STRUCTURE - KEY TO SUCCESS

### Building Mystery (Acts I & II)
1. **Act I**: Mike tells his story but SKIPS his Yavapai childhood—starts as servant to Captain Burns
2. **Act II**: Mike writes "Hoomothya's story" in third person—intimate detail puzzles readers
3. **Clues Accumulate**: Same events, same phrases, same tracking skills, same trauma
4. **Readers Realize**: Alert readers figure it out before reveal
5. **Chapter 20**: Mike finally admits the truth explicitly

### Why This Works
- **Mystery drives reading**: Who is Hoomothya? Why does Mike care?
- **Clues satisfy**: Readers feel smart piecing it together
- **Official reveal pays off**: Even if guessed, Mike's admission is cathartic
- **Dissociation shown**: Writing in third person demonstrates trauma
- **Integration**: Reveal is Mike finally claiming both identities
- **Emotional power**: 62 years of carrying this secret, finally spoken

### Clues Planted Throughout

**Act I (Mike's story)**:
- Starts as servant to Burns, skips how he got there (Why?)
- Hints at buried identity but never names it
- "They killed my family" (Who? Which family?)
- Tracking skills (Where did he learn?)
- "My own people" (Which people?)
- Guilt, survivor's guilt (Survivor of what?)
- Marriage to Chehata connects him to Yavapai culture
- December 22-28, 1872 dates may surface in memory fragments

**Act II (Hoomothya manuscript)**:
- Same dates as Mike's story (December 22-28, 1872)
- Same captain (James Burns)
- Same tracking skills learned
- Same "bitter vengeance" phrase
- Same massacre witnessed
- Same survival—only one living

**Accumulating Evidence**:
- Chapter 13 (Mother's death): "Bitter vengeance"—Mike hinted at family killed
- Chapter 16 (Capture): December 22—Brown capturing Hoomothya
- Chapter 17 (Six days): Hoomothya's captivity experience
- Chapter 18 (Massacre): Hoomothya witnessing Skeleton Cave
- Chapter 19 (Brought to Burns): Massacre survivor becomes Burns's ward—the reveal becomes undeniable
