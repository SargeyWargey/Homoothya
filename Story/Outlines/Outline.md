## PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS BEGINS (1920)

**Time**: 1920, Fort McDowell Indian Reservation
**POV**: First-person (Mike Burns, age ~55)
**Location**: Fort McDowell, Mike's home
**Word Count**: ~1,750 words

### Plot Function
Establish Mike Burns at a threshold moment: elderly, weathered by a lifetime of pain and survival, sitting down to write his story. **Shows**: Mike is educated (reads and writes English fluently), has lived through extraordinary events, carries tremendous pain visibly in his body and bearing. **His motivation**: Feels obligated to write and publish his story—owes it to his cousin Carlos Montezuma, owes it to his people, owes it to history. He has a unique perspective that must be recorded. **What he's writing**: Beginning with his life as Mike Burns, adopted by Captain Burns (Chapter 1 starts here). **NO mention**: Hoomothya, the cave, anything before the adoption. Sets stage for him to begin the manuscript readers will follow through Act I.

### Key Scenes
1. **Opening Image**: Mike Burns, age ~55, sitting at a simple wooden table at Fort McDowell. Late afternoon light. Weathered hands, scarred knuckles, body that carries visible pain—bent slightly, movements careful. Face lined with more than age.
2. **The Weight**: Physical description revealing a man who has endured: the way he holds himself, the silences in his breathing, the heaviness in his shoulders. Not broken, but bearing tremendous weight.
3. **The Blank Page**: Mike staring at empty paper, pencil in hand. Has put this off for years. Now feels he cannot wait any longer.
4. **The Obligation**: Internal reflection on WHY he must write—"I can read. I can write English. I have seen things others did not survive to tell. I have lived in both worlds. I owe this story—not just to my people, but to my cousin Carlos."
5. **Carlos's Influence**: Brief mention of his cousin Dr. Carlos Montezuma—the famous physician and activist, the man who has spent his life fighting for their people from platforms Mike never had. "Carlos fights with newspapers and speeches. I have only this: my witness, my words."
6. **The Unique Perspective**: Mike understanding his particular position—educated, literate, present at events most Yavapai did not witness from his angle, able to document what happened in the language of the White People who need to hear it.
7. **The Decision**: "I will start with the day I became Mike Burns. The day Captain James Burns took me into his household." (Readers don't know the context yet—what came before that day remains unspoken.)
8. **First Sentence Written**: Mike writes the opening line of Chapter 1—his story as Burns's adopted boy begins. The manuscript that will become Act I is starting.
9. **The Mission**: "This will be published. It must be. The White People have heard only one side. Carlos has shown me that our voices matter, that our stories can reach beyond our people. I will write this, and I will find a way to make them read it."

### Emotional Beat
DETERMINATION + OBLIGATION + PAIN CARRIED + WITNESS DUTY + HONORING CARLOS + MISSION BEGINNING

### Notes
**Purpose of This Prologue**:
- **Establishes Mike's character**: Elderly, weathered, carrying visible pain and trauma, but determined
- **Shows his education**: Literate, fluent in English, understands power of written word
- **Motivation clear**: Owes it to Carlos (his cousin) to write the Yavapai story; owes it to his people; has unique perspective that must be recorded
- **Sets the frame**: Mike is writing the manuscript readers will follow—starting with "becoming Mike Burns" (Chapter 1)
- **NO mention of before**: Hoomothya, the cave, his Yavapai childhood—all unspoken. Story starts with adoption.
- **Carlos connection established**: Mike's cousin, the famous Dr. Carlos Montezuma, planted in readers' minds as motivation and relationship (sets up later chapters)
- **Witness mission**: Mike understands his role as documentarian, truth-teller, the one who can bridge both worlds
- **Foreshadows publication struggle**: Mike's determination to publish despite knowing it will be difficult
- **Simple, intimate opening**: Just one man, one table, one blank page, one decision to finally tell the truth

**What This Avoids**:
- No mention of Skeleton Cave or massacre
- No mention of Hoomothya or Yavapai childhood
- No scenes with Carlos present (he's mentioned as motivation, but not in scene)
- No journey to any specific place
- Keeps maximum mystery about Mike's origins and "before"

**What This Accomplishes**:
- Reader meets Mike as he is: survivor, witness, determined to write
- Establishes the meta-narrative: Mike writing his story
- Plants Carlos as important figure without explaining their shared history yet
- Creates immediate question: What is Mike's story? Why does he carry such visible pain? What does he owe Carlos?
- Simple, powerful opening: man at table, ready to bear witness

## ACT I: MIKE BURNS'S LIFE (Chapters 1-12)
### Mike's partial life story and Carlos's intervention

**CRITICAL**: Mike tells his story starting from his time as Captain Burns's servant, never mentioning his Yavapai childhood or the name Hoomothya. Readers wonder: What happened before? Why won't he talk about it? **Mike completes his manuscript and tries to publish, facing rejection. Chehata encourages him to contact cousin Carlos Montezuma for help. Act I ends with Carlos breaking through Mike's avoidance, pushing him to write "Hoomothya's story."**

- Chehata becomes bridge to culture Mike lost in unnamed childhood trauma
- Show Mike's emotional reaction to speaking Yavapai again without explaining WHY he lost it
- Her family's teaching him = clue he grew up Yavapai but was separated
- Plant detail: Chehata is Tolkepaya (western Yavapai); Mike seems to be from different band (unnamed)

## CHAPTER 7: FAMILY AND WITNESS

**Time**: 1889-1905 (ages ~24-40)
**POV**: First-person (Mike)
**Location**: Arizona reservations (San Carlos area, later moving toward Fort McDowell region)
**Word Count**: ~3,500 words

### Plot Function
After marriage, Mike and Chehata build family (six children) while Mike reconnects with Yavapai culture and begins forming witness mission. **Mike tries to reconnect with "his people" but readers still don't know his exact origin.** Neither white nor fully accepted by Natives. Chehata grounds him. Children give him hope and purpose. Cultural learning alongside children. Seeds of manuscript work.

### Key Scenes

10. **First Writing Attempts**: Mike beginning to record Yavapai place names, stories, customs—"so my children will know"
11. **Purpose Crystallizing**: Must preserve these stories, must tell what happened (what happened? readers wonder)
12. **Chehata's Support**: She believes in his mission, manages household while he writes
13. **Family as Resistance**: Raising Yavapai children who know their language and culture = defying cultural genocide

### Emotional Beat
SEARCHING + FAMILY GROUNDING + CULTURAL HEALING + MISSION EMERGING + HOPE THROUGH CHILDREN

### Notes
**CRITICAL FOR MYSTERY**:
- Mike says he's teaching his children "our ways"—but he had to relearn them from Chehata's family. Why?
- Carlos possibly named after "cousin" Dr. Carlos Montezuma—readers don't know who that is yet
- Mike writing "so my children will know" what? About their people? About what happened to him?
- Show Mike's fluency in Yavapai returning—he knew it once, lost it, reclaiming it
- His dual role: accepted for practical skills (English literacy) but suspect for past (scout service)

8. **Carlos's Encouragement**: "Now write your story. Our people need the truth told."
9. **Seed Planted**: Mike begins seriously considering writing his manuscript

### Emotional Beat
ADVOCACY + EFFECTIVENESS + FINDING VOICE + BITTERSWEET VICTORY

## CHAPTER 9: BROKEN PROMISES - A WITNESS ACCOUNT

**Time**: 1905-1909 (ages ~40-44) - Mike reading what he's written to Chehata
**POV**: First-person (Mike) - Frame narrative of Mike reading his testimony aloud to Chehata
**Location**: Fort McDowell Reservation, evening at home
**Word Count**: ~4,000-5,000 words (condensed and reframed)

### Plot Function
Mike has written his testimony about Rio Verde and the March of Tears—documenting the broken promises and atrocities he witnessed as a child in Burns and Bishop's care. Now he reads this testimony aloud to Chehata, seeking her validation that he's captured their people's story correctly. The framing is intimate: an evening scene where Mike shares what he's written, Chehata listens and responds, and we experience the events through Mike telling Chehata what he witnessed and what survivors told him. This approach captures the essence and pain of the historical events while maintaining emotional intimacy through the present-moment interaction between Mike and Chehata.

### Structure
**Frame narrative**: Mike and Chehata sitting together in the evening at Fort McDowell. He reads his written testimony to her, pausing to explain, to feel her reactions, to ask if he's gotten it right. Within this frame, readers experience the key events through Mike's testimony voice—what he witnessed, what survivors told him, how he's documented it all.

### Key Scenes

**OPENING FRAME: THE READING BEGINS**
1. **Evening at Home**: Mike and Chehata after a long day working Fort McDowell irrigation ditches—children elsewhere, quiet moment alone
2. **The Manuscript Pages**: Mike brings out what he's been writing—testimony about Rio Verde and the March of Tears
3. **His Vulnerability**: "I need you to tell me if I captured it right. You know these stories—your family lived through San Carlos. Did I tell it true?"
4. **Chehata's Role**: She settles in to listen, knowing this matters deeply to him and to their people
5. **Mike Begins Reading**: "I set this down so the world may know. The White People have heard only one side."

6. **Crook's Promise** (April 1873): Mike reading about hearing General Crook promise the Yavapai and Tontos "as long as they lived" they could stay at Rio Verde—he was 8, in Burns's barracks, overhearing
7. **Chehata's Reaction**: She nods—"My grandmother told me about that promise. Everyone believed it."
8. **Mike Reads: The Settlement**: ~3,500 people at Rio Verde, wheat and barley and corn raised—proving they could do everything asked
9. **Mike's Voice**: "I wrote: 'They proved they could do everything asked. It didn't matter.' Did I say that too harshly?"
10. **Chehata**: "Not harsh enough. Say it again—louder."
11. **Mike Reads: The Disease**: Massive outbreak 1873-1875, ~1,500 dead—he writes: "The Indians believed Dr. Williams poisoned them. I heard the whispers in the officers' quarters."
12. **Mike's Pain**: "I was just a child. I couldn't help. I could only watch them die from a distance."
13. **Chehata's Hand on His**: "You were a child. But now you're writing it down. That's how you help."

**MIKE READS: THE MARCH OF TEARS (February 1875)**
14. **The Broken Promise**: Mike reading: "'As long as they lived' became two years."
15. **Chehata's Anger**: "They lied. They always lied."
16. **Mike Reads: The Order**: Late February 1875, forced to leave for San Carlos—second lie: "Return in 5-7 years"
17. **Mike's Commentary**: "I knew even at age 10 this was a lie. Should I say that in the testimony?"
18. **Chehata**: "Yes. Say it. You knew what they were doing."
19. **Mike Reads: The Journey**: 20 days, ~2,000 people marching, short rations, hunger—Mike rode with Army escort while people walked
20. **Mike's Impossible Position**: He stops reading, voice breaking—"I was fed while our people starved. I rode while they walked. I was ten years old with the men destroying our people's lives."
21. **Chehata**: "You remembered everything. That's what matters now."
22. **Mike Reads: East Verde Violence**: Conflict between Tontos and Apache Yumas/Mojaves—30-35 Tontos killed—Al Sieber wounded
23. **Mike Reads: Arrival at San Carlos**: "Thrown among a lot of people they did not know"
24. **Mike Reads: His Child-Heart**: Quotes his own memory: "Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance I shall live long enough to come back."
25. **Mike's Present Voice**: "But I was wrong. I did come back. And now I'm writing it down."
26. **Chehata's Tears**: "You came back. We came back. That's our victory."

**MIKE READS: SURVIVOR TESTIMONIES**
27. **Later Accounts**: Mike reading how survivors told him what he couldn't see as a child—starvation at San Carlos, disease, broken families
28. **Naming the Dead**: "I set down every name they gave me. Every person who died because of broken promises."

31. **Mike Reads: Witness Mission**: "I am the only one living who was present at Rio Verde, present on the March, and present now at Fort McDowell. This is my testimony."

**CLOSING FRAME: CHEHATA'S VALIDATION**
32. **Mike Finishes Reading**: Sets pages down, exhausted and vulnerable
33. **Silence**: Chehata absorbing what she's heard
34. **Her Verdict**: "You told it true. This is what happened. Our people need the White People to read this."
35. **Mike's Relief**: "I wanted to honor what they suffered. What we all suffered."
36. **Chehata**: "You did. You witnessed it from a strange place—with the Army but not of them. Your heart with your people but your body with the enemy. That makes your testimony powerful. You saw both sides."
37. **Mike's Gratitude**: "Without you and your family teaching me what I'd lost, I couldn't have written this. I wouldn't have known enough to tell it right."
38. **Chehata**: "Now you need to get it published. The White People need to read what they did to us. What they took from us. What we survived."
39. **Mike's Determination**: "I will. Somehow, I'll make them hear."
40. **Closing Image**: Mike and Chehata sitting together, the testimony pages between them—a record of atrocity and survival, written so the world will know

### Emotional Beat
TESTIMONY AS INTIMATE ACT + VALIDATION SOUGHT AND GIVEN + WITNESS PARTNERSHIP + PAIN SHARED + DETERMINATION TO PUBLISH + MYSTERY (Why does he say "my people" if he was with the Army?)

### Notes
**CRITICAL FOR NOVEL STRUCTURE**:
- **Frame narrative**: Mike reading to Chehata creates intimacy and present-tense emotion while conveying historical events
- **Shorter and more focused**: Captures essential events (Crook's promise, disease, broken promise, March of Tears, violence) without exhaustive detail
- **Chehata's crucial role**: She validates his testimony, adds family names, encourages publication—active partner in witness mission
- **Mike's unique position**: He witnessed from painful privilege (fed, sheltered with Army) but heart with his people—Chehata names this as strength
- **Emotional texture**: Mike's vulnerability, Chehata's anger and tears, their shared determination—brings historical events to life through present interaction
- **Mystery preservation**: Mike says "my people," "our people," "my homeland"—but still doesn't explain his Yavapai origins to readers
- **Historical accuracy maintained**: All key events documented (Rio Verde settlement, disease outbreak, broken promises, March of Tears, East Verde violence, San Carlos arrival)
- **Sets up**: Mike's determination to publish (Chapter 11), his relationship with Carlos Montezuma, the witness mission
- **Word count**: ~4,000-5,000 words captures essential testimony within intimate frame without excessive length

**WRITING APPROACH**:
- Open with quiet evening scene—Mike and Chehata alone, manuscript pages ready
- Use dialogue rhythm: Mike reads passage → pauses → Chehata responds → Mike continues or comments → repeat
- Show Mike's physical and emotional reactions: voice breaking, hands shaking, needing Chehata's presence
- Show Chehata's responses: tears, anger, validation, adding family names
- Keep historical testimony clear and direct when Mike reads it
- Balance showing (key moments from testimony) with efficiency (not every detail)
- End with their shared determination: this testimony must reach the world
- Emphasize: Mike wrote it, but Chehata validates it—their people's story told together

### Emotional Beat
COMPLEX PRIDE + BITTER COST + ASSERTION

## CHAPTER 11: THE MANUSCRIPT

**Time**: Early 1922 (age ~57) - approximately one month before Carlos's return to Arizona
**POV**: First-person (Mike)
**Location**: Fort McDowell area
**Word Count**: ~2,500 words

### Plot Function
Mike completes his manuscript telling his life story from the Yavapai perspective—covering his life from after the massacre (1872) through Carlisle, army service, marriage, witness to broken promises, and building family at Fort McDowell. This is the story of atrocities done to his people, told from the Native viewpoint. He sends it to Sharlot Hall seeking publication but faces rejection—no publishers want to print the Indian perspective. **Mike shares his pain with Chehata, who suggests he talk to Carlos Montezuma, who is planning to move back to Arizona next month.** Shows the struggle to get Native witness published and sets up Carlos's intervention.

### Key Scenes
1. **Completion**: Mike finishes his manuscript—his life and witness from after the massacre through the present day, told from the Yavapai/Indian perspective
2. **The Story He Wrote**: Covers his time as Burns's ward, Carlisle, army service, witnessing Rio Verde and March of Tears, marriage, family, voting rights—documenting atrocities against his people
3. **Reading Aloud**: Mike reads portions to Chehata—powerful testimony of what was done to the Yavapai
4. **Chehata's Response**: "This is important. The White People need to hear this from you. They need to know what they did to us."
5. **First Publication Attempt** (January 1910): Mike sends manuscript to Sharlot Hall with letter seeking help publishing
6. **The Letter**: Mike writes of "telling the White People they have heard only one side" and documenting the truth of what happened to his people
7. **Hall's Response**: Kind but discouraging—publishers aren't interested in Native perspectives; the Indian story isn't what white readers want
8. **More Rejections**: Mike tries other publishers, faces consistent rejection—too controversial, too accusatory, "not marketable"
9. **Pattern Emerges**: They're willing to hear "civilized Indian" success stories, but not testimony about broken promises and massacres
10. **The Pain**: Mike's discouragement deepening—spent years documenting truth no one wants to hear
11. **Evening Conversation with Chehata**: Mike expresses his pain and frustration—"What was the point of writing it all down if no one will publish it?"
12. **Chehata's Understanding**: She sees his pain, validates the importance of his witness
13. **Her Encouragement**: "This story matters. You documented what happened—that alone is important, published or not."
14. **Mike's Doubt**: "But if no one reads it, if it just sits in a drawer..."
15. **Chehata's Suggestion**: "Carlos is moving back to Arizona next month. He's coming home. Talk to him about it—he knows how to get Native voices heard."
16. **Decision**: Mike decides to show the manuscript to Carlos when he arrives, ask for his advice on publication
17. **Hope Rekindled**: Carlos coming home—family connection, shared understanding, and maybe wisdom about how to get the Indian perspective published
18. **Waiting**: One month until Carlos arrives in Arizona

### Emotional Beat
COMPLETION + HOPE + REJECTION + PAIN + PARTNERSHIP WITH CHEHATA + NEW STRATEGY

### Notes
**CRITICAL FOR NOVEL STRUCTURE**:
- **The manuscript is about Mike's life FROM the massacre forward**—his witness to atrocities told from Yavapai perspective
- **It's NOT about trying to publish "Hoomothya's story"**—Mike hasn't written about before the massacre yet; that comes after Carlos pushes him in Ch 12
- **Publication struggle is about Native perspective being unwelcome**—white publishers don't want Indian testimony about what was done to them
- **Chehata's crucial role**: She's the one who thinks of Carlos as resource for getting Native stories published
- **Sets up Chapter 12**: Carlos will read the manuscript and recognize what's MISSING—the before, Hoomothya's story
- **Historical accuracy**: Mike did write to Sharlot Hall in 1910; this chapter shows that real effort
- **Mike's witness mission clear**: He's trying to get the Yavapai truth published, facing systematic rejection
- **Pain is specific**: Not just "nobody wants it" but "they don't want the Indian side of what happened"

**WHAT THE MANUSCRIPT CONTAINS**:
- Mike's life after the massacre (Chapter 8-10 territory—Rio Verde, March of Tears, Fort McDowell, voting)
- Testimony about broken promises and atrocities from Native perspective
- Documentation of what the Army did to the Yavapai people
- Mike's witness as someone who was there and saw it all

**WHAT'S STILL MISSING** (Carlos will identify this in Ch 12):

## CHAPTER 12: THE COUSIN (Dr. Carlos Montezuma - The Push to Write Hoomothya) (ACT I CLIMAX)

**Time**: February 1922 (approximately one month after Chapter 11)
**POV**: First-person (Mike, age ~57)
**Location**: Fort McDowell area
**Word Count**: ~3,500 words

### Plot Function
Carlos Montezuma returns to Arizona after years away, settling at Fort McDowell as promised. Mike shows him the completed manuscript about his life as Mike Burns—his witness testimony about atrocities against the Yavapai. Carlos reads it and recognizes what's missing. **Carlos now specifically pushes Mike to write about "before"—about his childhood, about the dark past he's avoiding, about the boy he was.** He challenges Mike to tell the WHOLE truth—not just witness testimony about what happened to his people, but the deeply personal story of both their childhoods, the pain, the loss. Carlos emphasizes that this complete story is necessary not just for publication but as a permanent record for future generations and Mike's own children. Mike resists, but Carlos plants the seed: "Tell the story of Hoomothya."

### Key Scenes
1. **Carlos's Arrival**: Carlos returns to Fort McDowell as promised, about a month after Chehata suggested Mike contact him
2. **Reunion**: Mike and Carlos together—two elderly men, cousins, shared history readers don't fully understand yet
3. **Carlos's Health**: Visibly aging but still vital—capable of hiking, working, actively engaged (NOT yet in serious decline)
4. **The Manuscript Exchange**: Mike shows Carlos his completed manuscript—the story of "Mike Burns" and witness testimony about Yavapai suffering
5. **Carlos Reads**: Carlos reads through Mike's work over several days—Captain Burns, Carlisle, Highland, army service, Chehata, family, Fort McDowell, witness testimony
6. **Mike Explains His Struggles**: Mike tells Carlos about his years of trying to get published, the rejections, publishers who don't want Native perspectives on atrocities
7. **Carlos's Understanding**: Carlos knows the publication fight well—he's spent his life battling to get Native voices heard through Wassaja and other channels
8. **Recognition of What's Missing**: Carlos finishes reading. Long silence. Thoughtful. "This is powerful testimony, cousin. You've documented what they did to our people. But something is missing."
9. **The Gentle Push**: "What about before?" Carlos asks quietly. "About your childhood before Captain Burns? About the boy you were?"
10. **Mike's Deflection**: Mike resists, clearly avoiding something. "I've written what matters. The witness testimony. What was done to our people."
11. **Carlos's Persistence**: "You're writing around something, cousin. There's a darkness you won't touch. A pain you won't name."
12. **Mike's Resistance**: Visible discomfort. "Some things..." He can't finish.
13. **Why It Matters - The Children**: Carlos: "Your children—Solomon, Carlos, Katie, Charlotte, Lula, Josie—they need to know where they come from. The family you lost. The child you were."
14. **Why It Matters - Permanent Record**: Carlos: "This is creating a record on paper that will last. A hundred years from now, two hundred years from now, your grandchildren's grandchildren need to know the whole truth."
15. **Why It Matters - Publication**: Carlos: "And if you want people to feel the truth instead of just reading facts, then you need to let them see the real cost. What it did to one boy."
16. **The Emotional Core**: Carlos: "You've written about what they did to the Yavapai. But you haven't written about what they did to YOU."
17. **Mike's Fear**: "If I go back there in my mind... I don't know if I can..."
18. **Carlos's Gentle Support**: "You can. I'll be here. Chehata will be here. And it's time, cousin."
19. **The Name - First Use**: Long pause. Carlos looks at Mike steadily. "Tell the story of Hoomothya."
20. **Who Is Hoomothya?**: Readers wondering—another relative? Another child? Why does that name make Mike go so still?
21. **Mike's Physical Reaction**: Can't speak. Something about that name cuts deep. The name hung in the air between them. Mike hadn't heard it spoken aloud in decades. It belonged to a child who had died, and he had spent fifty years trying to forget he existed.
22. **Carlos's Understanding**: "Think about it, cousin. That's all I ask." He doesn't push further—but the seed is planted.
23. **Mike's Night of Reflection**: Mike wrestles with Carlos's challenge—can he revisit his past? Can he tell the story of the boy he was?
24. **Morning Decision**: Mike returns to Carlos and commits to writing it
25. **Final Line - Second Use**: "I would tell the story of Hoomothya."

### Emotional Beat
REUNION + SHARED BURDEN + CARLOS'S GENTLE BUT FIRM CHALLENGE + PUBLICATION STRATEGY + LEGACY FOR CHILDREN + PERMANENT RECORD + EMOTIONAL TRUTH + HOPE THROUGH ALLIANCE + AVOIDANCE CONFRONTED

### Notes
**CRITICAL FOR MYSTERY**:
- **Timeline**: This is February 1922, one month after Chapter 11 (early 1922). Mike has completed his manuscript; Carlos has returned to Arizona as promised
- **Carlos's health**: Aging visibly but still vital—can hike, work, engage actively. NOT yet declining seriously. This sets up that he'll be able to make the cave journey in a future chapter
- **First mention of "Hoomothya"**—readers have NO IDEA who this is. Another child? A relative? Why does that name affect Mike so deeply?
- **"Hoomothya" is used ONLY TWICE in the chapter**: First when Carlos speaks it aloud, and the final line of the chapter: "I would tell the story of Hoomothya."
- **ACT I CLIMAX**: Carlos's challenge is the catalyst that pushes Mike to finally write Hoomothya's story
- Carlos has read Mike's complete manuscript and recognizes the gap—the missing "before," the "darkness Mike won't touch"
- **NO SPECIFIC MENTION of massacre details**—Carlos speaks vaguely: "about your past," "about the boy you were," "the darkness you won't touch," "what happened to you"
- NO MENTION of "cave," "family killed," or specific traumatic events—keeps it mysterious and avoids being too explicit
- Mike's resistance to writing about his past is visceral and painful—but specifics remain hidden
- Carlos knows more than he says—he understands the pain but doesn't name it for readers
- Plant mystery: Who is Hoomothya? Why does Carlos want Mike to tell "his" story? What is the dark past Mike is avoiding? What happened in his childhood?

**THREE-FOLD ARGUMENT FOR WRITING THE FULL STORY**:
1. **For His Children**: Mike's six children need to know where they come from, the family origins, the full story
2. **For Permanent Record**: Future generations (100+ years from now) need the complete truth preserved on paper
3. **For Publication**: Publishers need emotional truth and humanity, not just sanitized witness testimony

**CARLOS'S ROLE**:
- Strategic advisor on publication (he knows how to get Native voices heard through his Wassaja work)
- Family member who cares about Mike's children knowing their heritage
- Fellow survivor who understands Mike's pain without naming it for readers
- Challenges Mike to write the emotional truth, not just historical facts—to grieve on paper

**CARLOS'S PHYSICAL STATE**:
- Clearly aging—graying hair, lines on face, moving a bit slower
- But still robust enough to work, walk long distances, be actively engaged
- No signs yet of tuberculosis that will claim him next year (1923)
- Capable of physical challenges (sets up future cave hike without mentioning it explicitly)
- Health decline will happen later

**MYSTERY PRESERVATION**:
- **NO specific mention of**: cave, massacre, Skeleton Cave, December 1872, Army attack, family killed
- **ONLY vague references to**: "dark past," "the boy you were," "darkness you won't touch," "your past," "what happened to you"
- **The name "Hoomothya"** is used ONLY TWICE: when Carlos first speaks it, and in the final line of the chapter
- Carlos speaks vaguely: "the whole truth," "what they did to YOU," "that boy who lost everything"
- Mike's physical reaction (going still, can't speak, tears) suggests deep trauma but reveals nothing specific
- Even in Mike's internal reflection, he avoids specifics: "the child who had died," "what happened," "the rest," "the darkness"

**CHAPTER ENDS WITH**:
- Mike's night of wrestling with the decision
- His commitment the next morning to Carlos
- The final powerful line: "I would tell the story of Hoomothya."
- Readers left with questions: Who is Hoomothya? What is the dark past? What happened to Mike as a child?
- The name is mysterious and loaded with unspoken pain—used only twice for maximum impact

**SETS UP ACT II**:
- Carlos plants the seed that will bear fruit when Mike writes Hoomothya's story in Act II
- Mike will need to process this challenge before he can begin
- Readers will enter Act II wondering who Hoomothya is and why his story matters so much

---

## ACT II: HOOMOTHYA'S STORY (Chapters 13-23)

### Mike gives Hoomothya's witness in first person; intimacy replaces distance

**CRITICAL**: After Carlos's intervention (Ch 12 - Act I climax), Mike stops hiding behind third-person distance and writes Hoomothya's story as "I." Readers now live each moment of his childhood, flight, capture, and the massacre through his own eyes. The question shifts from "How does Mike know this?" to "How did this boy survive to become Mike Burns?"—the emotional reveal is carried inside the voice instead of withheld by perspective.

1. Pre-dawn departure from Fort McDowell—Chehata bundles food, frost hardens the corrals, and Carlos steadies himself despite a worsening cough while Mike shouldering the blankets meant for the bones.
2. Riding east through the winter desert: saguaros silhouetted against bruised clouds, creosote scent lifted by cold wind, both men quiet until the Dripping Springs quartzite begins catching pale sun along the Salt River rim.
3. Standing over the canyon lip where Hoomothya once guided soldiers—diabase shadows pooling below, river roar rising, and Carlos murmuring a prayer before they begin the descent.
4. The hazardous climb: crossing the black lava bed, edging along the narrow ledge, lowering bundles by rope while the wind scours their faces and Carlos nearly stumbles until Mike braces him.
5. Inside Skeleton Cave: the dust, the smell of age, handling brittle bones with buckskin gloves, whispering names they remember, and wrapping remains in wool with ceremonial songs.
6. Departure into a winter squall: sleet stinging skin, footing treacherous as they haul their burden upward, Mike recalling the same slope where his family once fled; a near fall underscores the stakes.
7. On the return trail Mike asks to veer toward the place the cousins were separated—passing the twisted juniper shaped like an old man, the red-rock cairn, and the spring that tasted like metal in Chapter 16.
8. Discovering the lone cottonwood still standing; Mike digs at its base with his hands, uncovering the smooth grinding stones polished by generations of women before him.
9. Beneath the stones lies the unfinished bow he abandoned as a boy; Mike cradles the cracked stave, sees it as a life cut short like his people, collapses into sobs, and Carlos kneels, wiping his face and whispering “Homothya, Wet Nose,”.

### Emotional Beat
SACRED DUTY + PERILOUS RETURN + CATHARTIC GRIEF

### Notes
- Keep the pilgrimage focused solely on Mike and Carlos; any logistical help happens off-page.
- Reuse established landmarks (twisted juniper, red-rock cairn, metal-tasting spring, cottonwood) to tie back to Chapters 13, 16, 21.
- Lean into storm imagery and the unfinished bow as metaphor for interrupted Yavapai lives, setting up Carlos's impending death in Chapter 25.

### Key Scenes
1. **Homecoming Twilight**: Mike and Carlos reach Chehata's house at dusk; she embraces them, taking in Carlos's drain and the way Mike clutches the pilgrimage bundle.
2. **Unspoken Bow**: Over stew Chehata gently asks what they found; Mike only says the old bow is "still hard to talk about," and she sees the depth without more words.
3. **Carlos Fading, Spirit Brightening**: Night visit shows Carlos's coughing fits and failing appetite, yet he speaks with renewed serenity about the cave and their people, revealing how the pilgrimage lifted his spirit even as his body weakens.

6. **Promise by the Fire**: That evening Carlos charges Mike to finish the manuscript and use the pilgrimage proof, pressing his physician's bag into Mike's hands.
7. **Sharlot Hall Meeting**: Mike travels to Prescott, presents the complete story and relics; Sharlot is moved, promises to advocate, but warns she cannot guarantee publication.
8. **News in the Night**: Nearly three weeks after their return, Chehata wakes Mike—Carlos slipped away peacefully while they slept.

### Emotional Beat
WEARY HOPE + SACRED CLOSURE + URGENT TESTIMONY + QUIET LOSS

### Notes
- Entire chapter spans roughly three weeks between the pilgrimage homecoming and Carlos's death.
- Thread in quiet moments—Carlos humming old songs, asking Chehata about traditional remedies, urging Mike to write—so readers feel the pilgrimage rekindled his spirit despite failing health.
- Keep the bow mention minimal—simply that it is too painful for Mike to discuss, which Chehata understands.
- Ground Sharlot Hall as compassionate yet realistic; she will try to help but cannot promise success.
- Finish on the news of Carlos's passing; the death and burial rituals unfold in Chapter 26.

## CHAPTER 26: THE BURIAL

**Time**: February 1923
**POV**: First-person (Mike)
**Location**: Fort McDowell Cemetery (Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery) and Mike's homestead
**Word Count**: ~2,500 words

### Plot Function
Carry the reader from the moment news of Carlos's death spreads through Fort McDowell into the collective mourning that follows. Show the breadth of the lives Carlos saved, the return of Mike's far-flung family, and the way shared testimony reshapes Mike's understanding of his cousin's legacy. Close with Mike sealing that legacy by placing the beach shell on Carlos's grave and vowing to keep telling the story.

### Key Scenes

6. **Funeral Procession**: A long column of walkers, riders, and wagons moves toward the cemetery with songs rising in Yavapai and English while Mike steadies his grandchildren who carry baskets of desert flowers.
7. **Graveside Moment**: As the coffin is lowered, Mike places the beach shell from their pilgrimage on top of Carlos's chest just before the first shovels of earth fall, promising aloud that he will keep their story alive. He will be buried next to the bones of his family that he brought home.
8. **Family Vigil**: After the burial, Mike returns to a home packed with three generations where late-night conversation turns to legacy, ensuring his children and grandchildren understand the charge to bear witness with him.

### Emotional Beat
COMMUNAL GRIEF + LEGACY AFFIRMED + FAMILY REUNION + SWORN TESTIMONY

### Notes
- Use the spread of the news as engine for the chapter so the reader feels the widening circles of impact created by Carlos's life.
- Make the return of Mike's children and grandchildren a point of pride and vulnerability as Mike confronts the years he spent writing instead of providing.
- Let outside speakers highlight Carlos's medical heroism while Mike's family holds the quieter memories of his generosity and stubborn hope.
- Highlight the beach shell as sacred evidence from the cave pilgrimage which becomes part of the burial rite.
- Close on Mike's spoken promise and the shared resolve within the family to protect the story for future generations.

## Plot Function

This chapter transitions from the novel's narrative to historical record, documenting what is known about the period after Carlos Montezuma's death in January 1923 through the present day. Written as an author's note rather than from Mike's perspective, it distinguishes verified historical facts from fictional elements created for the novel, traces the journey of Mike's manuscript from his death to publication, and connects the historical struggles of the Yavapai people to their ongoing fight for justice today.

## Key Scenes

### PART I: CARLOS MONTEZUMA'S FINAL JOURNEY AND DEATH (January 1923)

**1. The Pilgrimage to Skeleton Cave (Early January 1923)**

In December 1922, Dr. Carlos Montezuma left Chicago and returned to Arizona for the final time, gravely ill with tuberculosis. In early January 1923, he may have led or joined an expedition to Skeleton Cave to retrieve the remains of massacre victims. Historical accounts vary on who accompanied him. Yavapai elder John Williams provided oral testimony in 1975 stating that he, Mike Burns, George Dickens, and Charles Dickens made the journey with Montezuma. The party climbed the difficult terrain to the cave site and recovered skeletal remains of Yavapai people killed on December 28, 1872.

**2. What They Found**

John Williams later recalled finding "many bones" including small bones of children, scattered where victims had fallen more than fifty years earlier. The cave walls and floor were stained with dried blood that looked like "oil" splattered on the rock.

The discovery overwhelmed the group. Williams remembered Montezuma standing by the cave wall crying, and "we all start crying right there." They gathered the remains carefully for reburial.

**3. Carlos Montezuma's Death (January 31, 1923)**

Carlos died at Fort McDowell on January 31, 1923, less than a month after the possible pilgrimage, at approximately age 57. He was buried in the Fort McDowell cemetery.

### PART II: THE SKELETON CAVE REMAINS (1923-1985)

**4. Reinterment Efforts (1925-1933)**

In 1925, Mike Burns, along with a Maricopa County sheriff and several other Yavapai individuals, made a journey to Skeleton Cave to collect the bones that remained in the cave. This was a significant step in providing a proper burial for the victims.

The main reinterment of the remains took place in 1933. The bones were laid to rest in a mass grave in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell.

**5. The Mass Grave**

The skeletal remains recovered from Skeleton Cave were interred in a mass grave at the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell in 1933. A dedicated grave marker now commemorates the tragedy.

**6. Memorial Dedication (1985)**

On Memorial Day 1985, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation held a service and dedicated a tombstone over the mass grave. Norman Austin, then Fort McDowell tribal president, stated: "The record has never been set straight... the victims were Yavapais, not Apaches."

### PART III: MIKE BURNS'S FINAL YEARS AND DEATH (1923-1934)

**7. Writing Through Loss (1923-1934)**

After Carlos's death, Mike continued working on his manuscript. Historical records document his ongoing efforts to find a publisher:

- 1922: He gave a manuscript draft to Dr. William H. Corbusier for editing. Corbusier edited it but removed Mike's "charges against Anglos." Publishers rejected it.
- Spring 1929: Mike delivered a manuscript draft to Sharlot Hall. She edited a few pages but made no effort to publish it.

Throughout the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, Mike persisted in trying to get his testimony published, facing consistent rejection and indifference. A partial account was published in T. E. Farish's "History of Arizona" before World War I.

**8. Move to Fort McDowell (May 28, 1934)**

Mike moved to the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation at approximately age 69.

**9. Death (November 26, 1934)**

Mike Burns died on November 26, 1934, at the Fort Whipple hospital in Prescott, Arizona. He was approximately 69 years old.

His wife Chehata (married c. 1888) and their six children (Solomon, Carlos, Katie, Charlotte, Lula, and Josie) survived him.

**10. Burial**

Mike Burns was buried in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell. The exact location of his grave and details of his burial are not fully documented in available sources.

---

### PART IV: CARLOS AND MIKE'S SHARED LEGACY

**11. Two Paths, One Mission**

Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns represented complementary approaches to Indigenous advocacy:

**Carlos Montezuma**: Educated as a physician at elite institutions (University of Illinois, Northwestern Medical School), he used his platform to publish Wassaja magazine (1916-1922), co-found the Society of American Indians (1911), and challenge federal Indian policy in public forums. He called for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and advocated for Native American citizenship and self-determination.

**Mike Burns**: Educated at Carlisle Indian School (1880-1885) and employed as an Army scout (1885-1888), he chose the path of witness, documentation, and testimony through his manuscript. He spent decades writing and revising his account, attempting to get it published so the Yavapai perspective would be heard.

**12. Fort McDowell Reservation**

Together with other Yavapai leaders including Charles Dickens and George Dickens, Carlos and Mike worked to establish Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land.

The reservation was officially established by executive order on September 15, 1903 (signed by President Theodore Roosevelt), creating 24,680 acres from abandoned Fort McDowell Military Reserve land. This victory secured a land base for Yavapai people who had been imprisoned at San Carlos Reservation for 25 years following the 1875 March of Tears.

The irony was stark: the reservation was carved from the military post that had served as a base for operations against the Yavapai, including the Skeleton Cave Massacre.

---

### PART V: THE MANUSCRIPT'S SILENCE (1934-2000s)

**13. Preservation at Sharlot Hall Museum**

After Mike's death in 1934, his manuscript was preserved in the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona.

Sharlot Hall, the Arizona territorial historian Mike had first contacted on January 6, 1910 seeking publication help, had kept his papers. She died in 1943. The manuscript remained in the museum's archives, occasionally consulted by researchers but unpublished.

**14. Seventy-Six Years**

From Mike's death in 1934 to the first publication in 2010, seventy-six years passed.

During this time, mainstream Arizona histories continued to describe the Skeleton Cave incident (when mentioned at all) from the Army's perspective as a battle against hostile Indians. Mike's eyewitness testimony, the only firsthand survivor account, remained unknown to the general public.

**15. The Cave's Name**

After the 1872 massacre, the bodies of victims were left in the cave. Between 1905 and 1908, rancher Jack (Jefferson Davis) Adams led a group to the site and photographer Lubken took photographs of the remains still scattered in the cave.

The site became known as "Skeleton Cave," entering maps and local lore. The name referred to the physical evidence of the massacre visible to visitors, but for decades the full story of what had happened there on December 28, 1872 remained obscure because Mike Burns's account was unpublished.

**16. Looting and Desecration**

From 1905-1911, during Roosevelt Dam construction, the site was looted. Artifacts and human remains were removed. In 1984, a Phoenix outdoor writer was pictured with illegally taken material. Metal detectors were used and the cave floor was dug down three or more feet.

The site was not protected as a sacred place or massacre location until much later. This desecration continued for decades as another layer of violence against the Yavapai dead.

---

### PART VI: PUBLICATION (2010-2012)

**17. Rediscovery (Early 2000s)**

Around the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars working in the Sharlot Hall Museum archives recognized the extraordinary significance of Mike Burns's manuscript as a firsthand account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, forced assimilation, and Indigenous survival.

**18. First Publication (2010)**

"All My People Were Killed: The Memoir of Mike Burns (Hoomothya) A Captive Indian" was published by Sharlot Hall Museum Press, edited by Dr. John Langellier and Dr. Sandra Lynch.

The publication came exactly one hundred years after Mike first wrote to Sharlot Hall seeking publication help (January 6, 1910).

**19. Second Publication (2012)**

"The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian" was published by the University of Arizona Press. Gregory McNamee spent seven years compiling and editing the manuscript, providing historical context while centering Mike's own words.

This comprehensive edition included Mike's full life story alongside his testimony about Skeleton Cave, the March of Tears at Rio Verde Reservation, and the broader history of Yavapai dispossession.

**20. A Century of Waiting**

Mike's children did not live to see his work published. Some of his grandchildren may have been alive in 2010-2012 to witness their grandfather's testimony finally reaching the public.

His manuscript had waited a hundred years to be heard.

---

### PART VII: CHANGING THE RECORD

**21. The Power of One Witness**

Mike Burns had written in 1913: "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

As the only known firsthand survivor account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his testimony carries unique historical authority. His manuscript provides details unavailable in military records: the experience of being forced to guide soldiers to his family, witnessing the massacre, the brutality of Pima and Maricopa scouts afterward, and the human cost of the attack.

**22. Rewriting History**

With publication of Mike's testimony, historians and the public finally had access to the Yavapai perspective on Skeleton Cave.

Military reports had claimed a justified engagement against hostile combatants, with casualty counts of 54-76 dead. Mike's account revealed families sheltering in a cave, women and children among the approximately 225 dead, soldiers using ricochet fire off cave walls to shatter bodies, and rolling boulders to crush those trying to escape.

**23. From "Battle" to "Massacre"**

The narrative has shifted in historical literature and public understanding. Museums, textbooks, and historical markers have begun to change. The Yavapai perspective, carried by Mike's testimony, has forced a reckoning with the reality of what happened on December 28, 1872.

---

### PART VIII: THE ONGOING STRUGGLE

**24. Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Today**

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation continues on the reservation established in 1903. Current size is approximately 24,000 acres (40 square miles) with around 950 community members.

The reservation represents only a fraction of the millions of acres of ancestral Yavapai territory, which stretched across central Arizona from the Verde Valley to the Salt River Canyon and the Superstition Mountains.

**25. Water Rights**

The Verde River and Salt River water sources remain contested. The Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990 was a major victory, but urban development in Phoenix, agricultural interests, and mining operations continue to threaten Yavapai water access.

Legal battles over water rights continue more than a century after Mike and Carlos fought to preserve Fort McDowell, requiring constant defense of promises made in 1903.

**26. Land and Sacred Sites**

Surrounding the reservation, ancestral Yavapai lands remain in federal, state, or private hands. Sacred sites, including Skeleton Cave itself (located in Tonto National Forest and managed by the US Forest Service), are not under Yavapai control.

Access to traditional sites requires negotiation with federal agencies. The people must continually negotiate access to places that were theirs for thousands of years before European contact.

**27. Cultural Revitalization**

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation maintains cultural programs, including language revitalization efforts, a tribal museum, and a youth drum group to reclaim what boarding schools like Carlisle attempted to erase.

Traditional practices and ceremonies continue. The community honors its ancestors and asserts its continued presence on the land.

**28. Contemporary Witness**

Just as Mike Burns bore witness to the atrocities of his time, contemporary Yavapai people continue to document ongoing challenges: environmental destruction, bureaucratic neglect, and threats to sovereignty.

New generations of Yavapai advocates, writers, and activists carry forward the work Mike began with his manuscript, refusing to let their history be erased.

---

### PART IX: FULL CIRCLE

**29. Victory and Loss**

Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns achieved remarkable things:
- They helped secure Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land (1903)
- They documented their people's history in writing
- Their advocacy created legal precedents and preserved cultural knowledge
- Mike's manuscript eventually reached publication, forcing a reckoning with historical truth

Yet both died before Mike's manuscript was published:
- Carlos died January 31, 1923, at age 57
- Mike died November 26, 1934, at age 69
- Neither saw the vindication of Mike's witness reaching the world

**30. The Work Continues**

More than 150 years after the Skeleton Cave Massacre, the Yavapai people continue fighting for recognition, resources, and respect.

Mike's story is finally told, but the conditions that made it necessary (dispossession, violence, erasure) have not been fully remedied. The witness continues because the injustice continues.

**31. Why This Matters**

Mike Burns wrote so that future generations would know the truth. That truth is not merely historical but present.

It lives in ongoing Indigenous struggles for sovereignty, in fights to protect water and land, in efforts to preserve languages and cultures targeted for extinction. Mike's witness reminds us that genocide is not a single past event but an ongoing process requiring constant resistance.

**32. At Fort McDowell Cemetery**

Mike Burns is buried at the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, in the same cemetery where Carlos Montezuma was laid to rest in 1923 and where remains from Skeleton Cave were reinterred in a mass grave in 1933.

The cemetery connects the cousins in death as they were connected in life and links them to the ancestors they fought to honor. Yavapai people continue to visit, remember, and carry forward the work of witness.
