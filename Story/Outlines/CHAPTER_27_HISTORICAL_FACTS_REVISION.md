## Plot Function

This chapter transitions from the novel's narrative to historical record, documenting what is known about the period after Carlos Montezuma's death in January 1923 through the present day. Written as an author's note rather than from Mike's perspective, it distinguishes verified historical facts from fictional elements created for the novel, traces the journey of Mike's manuscript from his death to publication, and connects the historical struggles of the Yavapai people to their ongoing fight for justice today.

## Key Scenes

### PART I: CARLOS MONTEZUMA'S FINAL JOURNEY AND DEATH (January 1923)

**1. The Pilgrimage to Skeleton Cave (Early January 1923)**

In December 1922, Dr. Carlos Montezuma left Chicago and returned to Arizona for the final time, gravely ill with tuberculosis. In early January 1923, he may have led or joined an expedition to Skeleton Cave to retrieve the remains of massacre victims. Historical accounts vary on who accompanied him. Yavapai elder John Williams provided oral testimony in 1975 stating that he, Mike Burns, George Dickens, and Charles Dickens made the journey with Montezuma. The party climbed the difficult terrain to the cave site and recovered skeletal remains of Yavapai people killed on December 28, 1872.

**2. What They Found**

John Williams later recalled finding "many bones" including small bones of children, scattered where victims had fallen more than fifty years earlier. The cave walls and floor were stained with dried blood that looked like "oil" splattered on the rock.

The discovery overwhelmed the group. Williams remembered Montezuma standing by the cave wall crying, and "we all start crying right there." They gathered the remains carefully for reburial.

**3. Carlos Montezuma's Death (January 31, 1923)**

Carlos died at Fort McDowell on January 31, 1923, less than a month after the possible pilgrimage, at approximately age 57. He was buried in the Fort McDowell cemetery.

---

### PART II: THE SKELETON CAVE REMAINS (1923-1985)

**4. Reinterment Efforts (1925-1933)**

In 1925, Mike Burns, along with a Maricopa County sheriff and several other Yavapai individuals, made a journey to Skeleton Cave to collect the bones that remained in the cave. This was a significant step in providing a proper burial for the victims.

The main reinterment of the remains took place in 1933. The bones were laid to rest in a mass grave in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell.

**5. The Mass Grave**

The skeletal remains recovered from Skeleton Cave were interred in a mass grave at the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell in 1933. A dedicated grave marker now commemorates the tragedy.

**6. Memorial Dedication (1985)**

On Memorial Day 1985, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation held a service and dedicated a tombstone over the mass grave. Norman Austin, then Fort McDowell tribal president, stated: "The record has never been set straight... the victims were Yavapais, not Apaches."

---

### PART III: MIKE BURNS'S FINAL YEARS AND DEATH (1923-1934)

**7. Writing Through Loss (1923-1934)**

After Carlos's death, Mike continued working on his manuscript. Historical records document his ongoing efforts to find a publisher:

- 1922: He gave a manuscript draft to Dr. William H. Corbusier for editing. Corbusier edited it but removed Mike's "charges against Anglos." Publishers rejected it.
- Spring 1929: Mike delivered a manuscript draft to Sharlot Hall. She edited a few pages but made no effort to publish it.

Throughout the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, Mike persisted in trying to get his testimony published, facing consistent rejection and indifference. A partial account was published in T. E. Farish's "History of Arizona" before World War I.

**8. Move to Fort McDowell (May 28, 1934)**

Mike moved to the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation at approximately age 69.

**9. Death (November 26, 1934)**

Mike Burns died on November 26, 1934, at the Fort Whipple hospital in Prescott, Arizona. He was approximately 69 years old.

His wife Chehata (married c. 1888) and their six children (Solomon, Carlos, Katie, Charlotte, Lula, and Josie) survived him.

**10. Burial**

Mike Burns was buried in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell. The exact location of his grave and details of his burial are not fully documented in available sources.

---

### PART IV: CARLOS AND MIKE'S SHARED LEGACY

**11. Two Paths, One Mission**

Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns represented complementary approaches to Indigenous advocacy:

**Carlos Montezuma**: Educated as a physician at elite institutions (University of Illinois, Northwestern Medical School), he used his platform to publish Wassaja magazine (1916-1922), co-found the Society of American Indians (1911), and challenge federal Indian policy in public forums. He called for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and advocated for Native American citizenship and self-determination.

**Mike Burns**: Educated at Carlisle Indian School (1880-1885) and employed as an Army scout (1885-1888), he chose the path of witness, documentation, and testimony through his manuscript. He spent decades writing and revising his account, attempting to get it published so the Yavapai perspective would be heard.

**12. Fort McDowell Reservation**

Together with other Yavapai leaders including Charles Dickens and George Dickens, Carlos and Mike worked to establish Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land.

The reservation was officially established by executive order on September 15, 1903 (signed by President Theodore Roosevelt), creating 24,680 acres from abandoned Fort McDowell Military Reserve land. This victory secured a land base for Yavapai people who had been imprisoned at San Carlos Reservation for 25 years following the 1875 March of Tears.

The irony was stark: the reservation was carved from the military post that had served as a base for operations against the Yavapai, including the Skeleton Cave Massacre.

---

### PART V: THE MANUSCRIPT'S SILENCE (1934-2000s)

**13. Preservation at Sharlot Hall Museum**

After Mike's death in 1934, his manuscript was preserved in the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona.

Sharlot Hall, the Arizona territorial historian Mike had first contacted on January 6, 1910 seeking publication help, had kept his papers. She died in 1943. The manuscript remained in the museum's archives, occasionally consulted by researchers but unpublished.

**14. Seventy-Six Years**

From Mike's death in 1934 to the first publication in 2010, seventy-six years passed.

During this time, mainstream Arizona histories continued to describe the Skeleton Cave incident (when mentioned at all) from the Army's perspective as a battle against hostile Indians. Mike's eyewitness testimony, the only firsthand survivor account, remained unknown to the general public.

**15. The Cave's Name**

After the 1872 massacre, the bodies of victims were left in the cave. Between 1905 and 1908, rancher Jack (Jefferson Davis) Adams led a group to the site and photographer Lubken took photographs of the remains still scattered in the cave.

The site became known as "Skeleton Cave," entering maps and local lore. The name referred to the physical evidence of the massacre visible to visitors, but for decades the full story of what had happened there on December 28, 1872 remained obscure because Mike Burns's account was unpublished.

**16. Looting and Desecration**

From 1905-1911, during Roosevelt Dam construction, the site was looted. Artifacts and human remains were removed. In 1984, a Phoenix outdoor writer was pictured with illegally taken material. Metal detectors were used and the cave floor was dug down three or more feet.

The site was not protected as a sacred place or massacre location until much later. This desecration continued for decades as another layer of violence against the Yavapai dead.

---

### PART VI: PUBLICATION (2010-2012)

**17. Rediscovery (Early 2000s)**

Around the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars working in the Sharlot Hall Museum archives recognized the extraordinary significance of Mike Burns's manuscript as a firsthand account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, forced assimilation, and Indigenous survival.

**18. First Publication (2010)**

"All My People Were Killed: The Memoir of Mike Burns (Hoomothya) A Captive Indian" was published by Sharlot Hall Museum Press, edited by Dr. John Langellier and Dr. Sandra Lynch.

The publication came exactly one hundred years after Mike first wrote to Sharlot Hall seeking publication help (January 6, 1910).

**19. Second Publication (2012)**

"The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian" was published by the University of Arizona Press. Gregory McNamee spent seven years compiling and editing the manuscript, providing historical context while centering Mike's own words.

This comprehensive edition included Mike's full life story alongside his testimony about Skeleton Cave, the March of Tears at Rio Verde Reservation, and the broader history of Yavapai dispossession.

**20. A Century of Waiting**

Mike's children did not live to see his work published. Some of his grandchildren may have been alive in 2010-2012 to witness their grandfather's testimony finally reaching the public.

His manuscript had waited a hundred years to be heard.

---

### PART VII: CHANGING THE RECORD

**21. The Power of One Witness**

Mike Burns had written in 1913: "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

As the only known firsthand survivor account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his testimony carries unique historical authority. His manuscript provides details unavailable in military records: the experience of being forced to guide soldiers to his family, witnessing the massacre, the brutality of Pima and Maricopa scouts afterward, and the human cost of the attack.

**22. Rewriting History**

With publication of Mike's testimony, historians and the public finally had access to the Yavapai perspective on Skeleton Cave.

Military reports had claimed a justified engagement against hostile combatants, with casualty counts of 54-76 dead. Mike's account revealed families sheltering in a cave, women and children among the approximately 225 dead, soldiers using ricochet fire off cave walls to shatter bodies, and rolling boulders to crush those trying to escape.

**23. From "Battle" to "Massacre"**

The narrative has shifted in historical literature and public understanding. Museums, textbooks, and historical markers have begun to change. The Yavapai perspective, carried by Mike's testimony, has forced a reckoning with the reality of what happened on December 28, 1872.

---

### PART VIII: THE ONGOING STRUGGLE

**24. Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Today**

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation continues on the reservation established in 1903. Current size is approximately 24,000 acres (40 square miles) with around 950 community members.

The reservation represents only a fraction of the millions of acres of ancestral Yavapai territory, which stretched across central Arizona from the Verde Valley to the Salt River Canyon and the Superstition Mountains.

**25. Water Rights**

The Verde River and Salt River water sources remain contested. The Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990 was a major victory, but urban development in Phoenix, agricultural interests, and mining operations continue to threaten Yavapai water access.

Legal battles over water rights continue more than a century after Mike and Carlos fought to preserve Fort McDowell, requiring constant defense of promises made in 1903.

**26. Land and Sacred Sites**

Surrounding the reservation, ancestral Yavapai lands remain in federal, state, or private hands. Sacred sites, including Skeleton Cave itself (located in Tonto National Forest and managed by the US Forest Service), are not under Yavapai control.

Access to traditional sites requires negotiation with federal agencies. The people must continually negotiate access to places that were theirs for thousands of years before European contact.

**27. Cultural Revitalization**

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation maintains cultural programs, including language revitalization efforts, a tribal museum, and a youth drum group to reclaim what boarding schools like Carlisle attempted to erase.

Traditional practices and ceremonies continue. The community honors its ancestors and asserts its continued presence on the land.

**28. Contemporary Witness**

Just as Mike Burns bore witness to the atrocities of his time, contemporary Yavapai people continue to document ongoing challenges: environmental destruction, bureaucratic neglect, and threats to sovereignty.

New generations of Yavapai advocates, writers, and activists carry forward the work Mike began with his manuscript, refusing to let their history be erased.

### PART IX: FULL CIRCLE

**29. Victory and Loss**

Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns achieved remarkable things:
- They helped secure Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land (1903)
- They documented their people's history in writing
- Their advocacy created legal precedents and preserved cultural knowledge
- Mike's manuscript eventually reached publication, forcing a reckoning with historical truth

Yet both died before Mike's manuscript was published:
- Carlos died January 31, 1923, at age 57
- Mike died November 26, 1934, at age 69
- Neither saw the vindication of Mike's witness reaching the world

**30. The Work Continues**

More than 150 years after the Skeleton Cave Massacre, the Yavapai people continue fighting for recognition, resources, and respect.

Mike's story is finally told, but the conditions that made it necessary (dispossession, violence, erasure) have not been fully remedied. The witness continues because the injustice continues.

**31. Why This Matters**

Mike Burns wrote so that future generations would know the truth. That truth is not merely historical but present.

It lives in ongoing Indigenous struggles for sovereignty, in fights to protect water and land, in efforts to preserve languages and cultures targeted for extinction. Mike's witness reminds us that genocide is not a single past event but an ongoing process requiring constant resistance.

**32. At Fort McDowell Cemetery**

Mike Burns is buried at the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, in the same cemetery where Carlos Montezuma was laid to rest in 1923 and where remains from Skeleton Cave were reinterred in a mass grave in 1933.

The cemetery connects the cousins in death as they were connected in life and links them to the ancestors they fought to honor. Yavapai people continue to visit, remember, and carry forward the work of witness.
