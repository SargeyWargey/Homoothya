# Author's Note

The inspiration for this book came from my time living in Arizona, and yes, later a particular women I dated. I would often drive and hike through the mesas and the Bradshaw Mountains after work and on weekends, exploring the remnants of the past, whether from the Native American era or the mining era. There's something profound about seeing history carved in rock or stones stacked by people from so many years ago. These encounters inspired me to read their stories, to research and learn about the people who came before.

During that research, I came across the manuscript of a Native American man named Mike Burns. His story immediately grabbed hold of me. I read everything I could about this man and the Yavapai people, and I came away with a conviction: this is a story that deserves to be told to a wider audience.

I originally started working on this project in 2019 as an idea YouTube series, visiting these places, writing out scenes, and telling their stories. Over the years, it evolved into something more: this book. It's something I've worked on, on and off, for five years. What you're reading now is the first draft of that journey.

## Historical Fiction

I want to make clear that this is a **historical fiction novel**. I conducted research and put tremendous effort into keeping this story weighted toward the historical side rather than the fictional. However, I didn't want this to read like a manuscript or a history textbook. I wanted it to read as the story of one man's life, with narrative flow and emotional impact that does my best to honor his experience.

That said: nearly all the characters you'll meet are real people. Nearly all the events that take place are documented historical events. Where the historical record had gaps, I did my best to fill them in to create a cohesive narrative. There is a chapter at the end (donâ€™t go read it yet!) where I explain the specific liberties I took for the sake of storytelling, what is documented historical record, and what I added to bridge the gaps.

## An Invitation for Honest Feedback

I also want to encourage you to be honest with your thoughts about this book:

- Are there places where the story drags or becomes unclear?
- Are there characters you wish you felt more emotionally connected to?
- Is anything confusing?
- Any grammar, spelling, or technical issues you notice?
- Any continuity issues? - Mike moves around a lot and keeping where he was located was a challenge.

I've read this draft so many times that I worry I've become blind to its weaknesses. I want to make this really good, so please tell me where I've missed something: where the pacing lags, where I've included too much detail about things that don't matter, or where I haven't given enough detail to things that do, or where you want more story, or more emotional depth.

This is the very first draft that anyone has read. There's quite a bit that will likely change from here on out. The reason I'm sharing it with you now is precisely because I want your honest opinion while the story is still malleable. Don't feel awkward or hold back out of politeness. I want the truth. That's how this book will become what it needs to be.

Thank you for reading Mike Burns's story. And thank you for helping me tell it well.
