# CHAPTER 2: CARLISLE

## 1880-1885

The train that took me from Fort Laramie rolled through country that did not belong to any map I carried in my memory. The prairie gave way to hills thick with trees. Rivers ran brown instead of red, and the air smelled of coal smoke that settled on the back of my tongue. At every station new passengers climbed aboard with trunks and stiff collars. They glanced at me as if I were a curiosity and then went back to their newspapers. I pressed my forehead to the glass and watched the landscape blur. The words I knew in the hidden language inside me had no shapes for what I saw. I tried to name the colors in English instead. That was the tongue I would need where the train was taking me.

When we reached Pennsylvania the sky hung low and white. Rain blew sideways across the platform. Captain Bishop's letter had arranged for an agent from the school to meet me. The man held a slate that said Carlisle in chalk. He nodded when he saw the uniform the Army had given me and took my carpetbag without asking. We climbed into a wagon that rattled through streets lined with brick buildings and gas lamps. I had never seen so many chimneys. Smoke curled from them like warnings. The agent tried to make conversation. Where you from, son? How old are you? I answered with the facts he expected. Fifteen. Arizona Territory. My name is Mike Burns. The words felt practiced because they were. He smiled as if the answers pleased him and told me I would do fine. I kept my eyes on the windows and counted church steeples to steady myself.

Carlisle sat on the bones of an old cavalry post. The stone barracks flanked a parade ground, and everything smelled of wet wool and horse sweat. A flag snapped in the mist. I climbed the steps of the main building and walked into heat and noise. Boys and girls from nations I had only read about stood in line against the walls. Some clutched blankets, some stood barefoot on the plank floor, some cried in languages that braided together until the air itself sounded like a drumbeat. A white woman with a clipboard shouted orders. Cut hair in the west room. Showers in the wash house. Issue uniforms. I had thought myself prepared. I had worn Army blue for years. I knew the weight of obedience. Still, when the barber's clippers buzzed near my scalp I flinched.

My hair had been trimmed short at the forts, but not shaved. The man in the apron pressed my head down and took what little length remained. The clippers clicked against my skull until cold air kissed skin. Another boy sat beside me with his braids still bound in rawhide. He cried as the braids fell to the floor. The woman with the clipboard told him this was progress. I watched his hands curl into fists and forced my own fingers to stay open. When the barber finished with me he wiped the back of my neck with a damp towel and sent me to a table piled with uniforms. Gray wool instead of blue. Stiff collars. Buttons that shone like coins. The attendant looked at my measurements and said, Already tailored, I see. That will make life easier. I wondered for whom.

They marched us to the bathhouse. Steam rolled off the copper tubs. I stripped and stepped into water that stung with lye soap. The attendants scrubbed our backs as if we were pans that needed scouring. One boy resisted and was held down while the matron finished the job. I blinked against the soap in my eyes and reminded myself that survival was sometimes as simple as enduring without protest. When we came out, another attendant handed me underclothes stamped with the letters C I I S. Everything smelled of starch. My own clothes disappeared into a bin. I felt lighter and smaller without them, as if the uniform were not just fabric but a shell that erased whatever had been underneath.

That evening they assembled the new students in the chapel. Gas lamps hissed along the walls. Richard Henry Pratt stood at the front in a dark suit, his eyes hard as gunmetal. He spoke about civilization, about opportunity, about the great experiment we were now part of. He said the Indian must die in us so the man can live. The words slid through me like cold iron. I had heard officers talk like that all my life. Hearing it in a room full of children made my stomach twist. Pratt spoke of discipline, of Christian virtue, of industry. He promised we would become useful citizens. He said nothing about the families we had left or the languages sewn into our bones. The students sat stiff in the pews. Some stared at the floor. Others stared at him with expressions I recognized from the parade ground at Fort Whipple: the look of animals pressed against a fence.

That first week felt like being rebuilt from the outside in. Reveille at dawn, boots on the floorboards, the rush to wash and dress before the bell. We marched in lines to the dining hall, sat at long tables, bowed our heads for a prayer I already knew by heart. The food tasted of boiled salt pork and overcooked cabbage. Conversation was forbidden in any tongue but English. In the classrooms the teachers wrote letters on the blackboard and drilled the younger children on the alphabet. They tried to test me the same way until I read the passage aloud without stumbling. After that they moved me to a desk near the front and asked me to help translate instructions for boys who spoke Lakota or Cheyenne. I obeyed. It was easier to repeat orders than to explain why my chest ached while doing it.

In the afternoons the boys went to industrial training. Some learned carpentry, some shoemaking, some printing. I was assigned to the print shop because I already handled English well. The pressroom smelled of ink and molten lead. Mr. Given, the instructor, set my hands on the type case and taught me to pick letters one by one. Capital A in the upper left. Lowercase e in the middle compartment. I slid the type into the composing stick and felt the metal bite my fingertips. We set pages for the school newspaper, the Indian Helper. The paper carried stories about our progress and hymns and speeches praising the civilizing mission. I read every line before we locked the forms. Sometimes I caught mistakes in spelling. Sometimes I found sentences that said the pupils expressed gratitude for being saved. My gaze lingered on those sentences. I imagined the faces of the students quoted and wondered whether they had volunteered the words or merely nodded when prompted. Then I inked the press and pulled the lever because the work had to be finished before we marched back to the dormitories.

The routine left little time for memories to surface, which was how the routine kept us compliant. Yet fragments still slipped through. During singing practice the music teacher made us shape vowels until they matched hers. When she corrected me I almost replied in the old language out of stubbornness. I pressed my lips together and answered in English instead. At night quiet hours stretched between taps and sleep. I lay in the narrow bed and whispered names of mountains into my pillow so no one else could hear. If I forgot even one syllable I recited the list from the beginning. I told myself I was storing the words the same way Mr. Given stored type: sorted, ready, waiting for the day they would be needed.

Winter hit hard that first year. Snow crusted on the windowpanes. My breath steamed inside the dormitory. We had wool blankets, but the cold still searched out our bones. Illness swept the younger children. The matron carried buckets of disinfectant that smelled sharper than pine pitch. Those who broke the rules by speaking in their own languages had their mouths washed with soap. I counted the punishments and noted who administered them. I watched the boys from the Plains wince when they were forced into shoes. I saw a girl from the Southwest stare at the snow as if it were an animal she could not tame. I realized we were all being taught to move in bodies that no longer felt like ours.

By the second year I understood the rhythms well enough to anticipate the cracks. I volunteered for duties that let me walk the grounds after dark. My English made me valuable to the teachers. They trusted me to carry messages, to supervise younger students while they worked in the laundry, to escort visitors through the dormitories. I kept my spine straight and my face open. I listened. Carlisle drew curious ministers and congressmen. They came to hear Pratt speak about the success of assimilation. He introduced me as a model student. I shook their hands and said yes, sir, we are learning very fast. They smiled with satisfaction, unaware of how my gaze slid past them to the notes they carried. Letters sealed with wax. Reports destined for Washington. I imagined the words inside them and wondered what truths I might someday hide in such letters of my own.

The school newspaper assigned me to write short pieces about the workshops. I described shoe making, the blacksmith forge, the sewing room where the girls bent over needles. I learned to choose adjectives that pleased the teachers: industrious, obedient, improving. The practice taught me how words could be sharpened or softened to change a story. When I wrote private notes I stripped those qualifiers away. In letters to Captain Bishop I reported my progress in reading and mathematics. I thanked him for the chance to attend a fine institution. Then, in a line tucked at the bottom, I asked if he had heard anything about the people from the Rio Verde who had been moved to San Carlos. He answered that the matter was complicated. I folded his reply and slid it under my mattress. From that day I began keeping a quiet account of every question that went unanswered.

Carlisle's outing program sent us to live with white families during the summers so we could practice our lessons. My first placement was with a farmer near Mechanicsburg. The Fields family owned seventy acres of corn and hay. They expected me to rise before dawn, milk cows, and split wood. At night Mrs. Fields made me read passages from the Bible at the supper table. They praised my penmanship and told their neighbors I was nearly civilized already. They let me keep a small notebook if I promised to show them every page. I wrote the weather, the chores, the scriptures they assigned. After they went to sleep I used the last stub of candle to add what they would not think to ask. The smell of wet earth after rain. The loneliness of walking fields with no mountains to mark the horizon. The hunger that never quite faded no matter how much cornbread I ate because it was not the hunger of the body that hurt. When I returned to the school in autumn the Fields family sent a letter commending my manners. I carried the notebook in my pocket like a talisman.

Over the years faces came and went. Some students ran away and were brought back in irons. Others sickened and died. Their names were entered in the ledger with the same careful handwriting used for attendance. We marched past their empty bunks and kept our posture steady. In chapel the hymn numbers changed, but the message did not. Become industrious. Become humble. Become new. I complied outwardly, and because I excelled they made me a sergeant of the student company. I learned to call cadence in English. My voice carried across the parade ground. Inside, I counted in another tongue. One set of numbers kept my feet aligned with the column. The other kept time with a world that existed only in memory.

The library became my refuge. Shelves lined with books about geography, history, and scripture offered a quiet the dormitory never allowed. I read speeches by senators who believed the Indian problem could be solved through education. I read novels about boys who ran away to sea. I read newspapers from territories I had traveled as a child and saw how journalists described battles I had witnessed from the shadows. They reported victories with tidy sentences that ignored the smell of smoke and the sound of mourning. I understood then that the stories printed on clean paper could erase as easily as they could record. If I ever had the chance to set type for my own account, I would not soften what I had seen. I began copying passages that showed me how to structure arguments, how to bend a narrative. Ink stained my fingers even after I washed them. I did not mind. The stains felt like a promise.

Pratt believed discipline would cure us of the past, but memory is not a disease. It is a ember banked beneath ash. Sometimes the ember flared when I least expected it. During a geography lesson a map of the Arizona Territory hung on the wall. The teacher tapped the Verde River with her pointer and said the reservation there had been a brief experiment. I kept my expression still while my pulse hammered. After class I studied the map alone. The river was a thin blue line. The mountains were triangles scratched in ink. Standing in that classroom I decided that if the mapmakers would not draw our lives, I would learn to do it myself.

In the spring of 1885 they promoted me to the advanced class in composition. Miss Burgess assigned essays on topics like Industry Builds Character and The Blessings of Civilization. I wrote what she wanted to read. Then I wrote a second version late at night, hiding it in the lining of my trunk. In those hidden pages I described the ache of hearing younger boys forget the sounds of their own names. I described the silence that fell over the dining hall when inspectors walked through, and how that silence throbbed with all the words we were not allowed to speak. The act of putting ink to paper without permission filled me with a steadiness I had not felt since childhood. It was not joy. It was purpose.

By the end of my fifth year I knew the routines so well that I could have run the drill myself. I also knew that remaining would keep pressing me into a shape that did not fit. Highland University in Kansas had offered a place to promising students who wanted more schooling. Pratt recommended me. He told me I would do the school proud. I thanked him and agreed to go. Before I left Carlisle I walked the perimeter at dusk. The sun slid behind the barracks, turning the windows gold. I touched the stone wall and felt its chill. I remembered the boy who had arrived with a shaved head and a hollow heart. I was not the same, though the uniform made it easy for others to think so. I carried more English words than ever, and with them came a sharpened hunger. The train whistle sounded. I picked up my carpetbag, the same one that had carried me east, and stepped toward whatever waited west of Pennsylvania.

I did not know when I would be ready to use the power Carlisle had polished in me. I only knew that I was leaving with eyes wide open. The school had meant to strip me of what I carried from the beginning. Instead it gave me new instruments to defend it. I boarded the train and watched the campus recede through the window. The parade ground, the chapel, the print shop that smelled of ink and steam. I whispered a promise no one else could hear: I will remember. The wheels clattered over the rails. The east began to fall behind. I kept my gaze forward and the words ready on my tongue.
