# CHAPTER 2: THE PROMISE

## 1873-1875

Before the uniform stopped scratching, before I understood how to answer in English without thinking, there was the day General Crook promised my people they could stay. I stood behind Captain Burns on the parade ground at Camp Verde, a small shadow in a blue suit that did not fit. The spring wind smelled of river water and wood smoke. Across the open space nearly three thousand men, women, and children waited in silence. They had walked in under white flags, hunger hollowing their faces, eyes searching for mercy. Crook sat straight in the saddle. The interpreter stood at his stirrup, ready to make his words into Yavapai and Tonto Apache sounds. I kept my hands folded the way Mrs. Burns taught me and tried not to tremble.

"As long as they lived," Crook said, and the interpreter repeated it. The words dropped like stones into the stillness. "As long as they lived." I watched shoulders sag with relief, watched old men close their eyes, watched mothers pull children close and tell them the war was over. The people believed him because they wanted to believe. Because what other choice was there? Captain Burns nodded approval. The officers around him relaxed. I bit my tongue until I tasted blood, because the name that belonged to me a year earlier rose in my throat, and I knew I must not speak it here.

They led the surrendered people across the river to the agency at Rio Verde. I went with the officers every few days, carrying ledgers or mail sacks, running small errands that kept me close enough to see but far enough that I never crossed the invisible line that separated the post from the reservation. The irrigation ditch they dug shone like a new scar in the earth. I watched women plant wheat in neat furrows, watched men mend tools with hands that had once held bows. Children chased each other between rows of corn and barley, laughing in languages my tongue still understood when no one was listening. Flour, sugar, coffee, beans, bacon, fresh beef—every day the rations were measured out, and sometimes Lieutenant Bishop sent me to help tally them. I stood behind a table with a stub of pencil while women held out ration tickets with fingers cracked from work. They thanked the officer, not me. I answered in English and swallowed the words in the other language that wanted to follow.

At night, back at the post, the soldiers talked about how quickly the people were becoming civilized. They said the fields would make them quiet, said the fences would keep them from wandering. I lay in the small room off the kitchen and pictured the Verde River in flood, the cottonwoods in leaf, the mountains that framed the valley. I told myself I was only observing, only learning. But when I watched the people kneel by the irrigation ditch and let water run through their fingers, something inside me ached so sharply I had to grip the edge of the wagon to steady myself.

The first summer brought harvest. The wheat stood taller than any soldier. Barley heads bent heavy. Army officers posed for photographs beside the fields to prove that Indians could farm if they were guided properly. I carried the tripod for one photographer and stared at the faces gathered just outside the frame—women with scarves over their hair, old men leaning on staffs, boys my age who should have been my brothers. They did not look at the camera. They looked past it, toward the hills they were not allowed to climb anymore. I wanted to run to them, to say words that would explain why I was dressed like the men who had hunted them. Instead I fetched canteens, I held horses, I did everything the officers asked because obedience kept me fed and alive.

It did not keep the people alive. The sickness arrived in the cold months, quiet at first. A cough here, a fever there. Then the agency warehouse filled with bodies wrapped in blankets. They lay lined against the walls waiting for burial, the air thick with lye and despair. Doctor Josephus Williams mixed powders and handed out bitter draughts while whispers spread that he was poisoning them. I stood in a doorway with a basin of water and watched a mother press her lips to her daughter's forehead, pleading with eyes that never met mine. I wanted to bring her more blankets, to lift the girl and carry her into the clean air, to do anything. Captain Burns told me to fetch more quinine instead. By spring more than a thousand had died. The wailing at night reached the fort even with the windows closed.

I told myself the disease would pass and Crook's promise would hold. Some mornings the fields still shone green, and for a few hours the valley smelled of damp soil instead of grief. I clung to those hours. I repeated the promise in my head the way I repeated the prayers Mrs. Burns taught me. As long as they lived. As long as they lived. If I believed it hard enough, perhaps the words would stay true.

But fear changes people. Hunger and sickness leave little patience. Fights broke out over ration lines, over ditch water, over old wrongs carried into the new settlement. Tonto men shouted at Apache Mojaves. A knife flashed. Blood stained the dust beside the warehouse. Soldiers rushed in, rifles leveled. I pressed my back against the adobe wall, the ledger tight in my hands, and the same thought looped through my mind: this is going to break. This is going to break. The officers called it discipline. I called it the edge of a cliff.

Still, the people planted again. Still, women spread blankets near the river and pounded mesquite beans with stone pestles as if doing so could summon the life they had before. Children were born in canvas tents, their first cries mingling with the distant bugle notes from the fort. Two winters passed like that—hope measured in crops and graves, in promises repeated by men on horseback. When Crook rode through the agency, I walked close enough to see the frost catching in his beard. "Hold fast," he told the gathered headmen. "No one will move you." The interpreter said the words aloud, and the people nodded because they had to. I nodded too, though a chill ran through me colder than the morning air.

---

By the end of the second winter the promise felt thin as worn cloth. Rumors drifted across the parade ground—orders from Washington, letters about consolidation, talk that the Verde Valley was too valuable for Indians to keep. I listened while polishing boots and heard Captain Burns mutter that the Tucson merchants wanted the contracts back. I heard Lieutenant Bishop say the President had signed something. No one told me outright. They did not have to. I saw supply wagons loaded with extra chains. I saw soldiers oiling rifles that had been rack-still all season. I saw the agency clerk pause before writing the words "as long as they lived" in the ledger, his hand shaking. When I carried mail to the agency in late February, the headmen were waiting outside the office, faces carved from stone. They did not speak to me. They did not need to. The promise had already broken. We were all just waiting to hear it shatter aloud.

I walked back to the fort with the empty mail bag against my side. The river ran high with snowmelt, cold and fast. I whispered good-bye to it, though no one had yet ordered anyone to leave. I knew. Children know when something precious is about to be taken. I had known it before in a cave full of smoke. I knew it again on that road between the agency and the fort. I kept walking. I kept silent. And I carried the promise like a stone that would not dissolve.
