### c. 1870-1871
### Superstition Mountains, Arizona Territory
My uncle came for me before the sun cleared the eastern peaks.

"Come, Hoomothya," he said, standing at the edge of our ramada. "Today you learn to see."

I was awake before he spoke, had been waiting since first light turned the sky grey. I scrambled out from under the blanket, careful not to wake Nashta curled beside me. My mother looked up from the fire.

"He's too young," she said, but quietly, the way she said things she knew wouldn't change.

"I was younger," my uncle said. "And his father agrees."

She studied my face for a moment, then reached out and touched my cheek. "Then go. Listen well."

My uncle carried his bow, the wood dark with use, the string taut. A quiver hung across his back. I had nothing but myself, small and quick, eager to follow.

We walked north from camp as the sun rose, painting the canyon walls copper and gold. My uncle moved like water, his feet finding the quiet places between stones, his passing barely disturbing the dust. I tried to copy him, to place my feet where his had been, but I was clumsy. Twigs snapped under my weight. Gravel shifted and clicked.

He didn't tell me to be quiet. He just kept walking, smooth and certain, and I kept trying to match him.

The land rose as we climbed away from the river. Saguaros stood tall on the slopes, their arms reaching up like people frozen in prayer. A jackrabbit burst from behind a creosote bush, and my uncle's hand touched my shoulder, holding me still until the animal disappeared over a rise in four great leaps.

"Too fast," he said. "Too thin. We want deer."

We walked for a long time. The sun climbed, and the heat built, and my legs began to ache. But my uncle showed no sign of stopping, so I didn't either. Pride kept my feet moving when tiredness pulled at them.

Finally, where a small canyon opened between red rock walls, he stopped. His hand rose, fingers spread. I froze.

He knelt and pointed to the ground.

"Come. Quiet."

I crept forward and knelt beside him. At first, I saw nothing but dirt and scattered pebbles. Then his finger traced a shape in the dust, and I saw it: a split heart pressed into the earth, the mark of something that had passed this way.

"Deer," my uncle said. "A doe. See how the toes spread? She's heavy. Maybe carrying a fawn."

I leaned closer. The print was beautiful, clear as a drawing. Two crescents joined at the point, the edges sharp where her weight had pressed down.

"How do you know it's a doe?"

"Size. A buck's track is bigger, deeper. His hooves strike harder." My uncle's finger moved to another print, this one smudged and partial. "This is from yesterday. See how the edges crumble? Fresh tracks hold their shape."

He stood and moved ahead, following something I couldn't see. Then he stopped and pointed again. A pile of dark pellets scattered near a mesquite tree.

"She stopped here. Ate the low pods, see?" He showed me where branches had been stripped clean while others, higher up, still hung heavy with fruit. "Deer don't climb trees."

I smiled despite myself.

We followed the tracks deeper into the canyon. My uncle showed me where she'd scraped against a palo verde, where she'd paused to drink from a rocky depression still holding yesterday's rain. The land became a story written in dust and bent grass and stones turned over to show their darker undersides.

"You have to see the small things," my uncle said. "The world talks to those who listen. A broken spider web. A bird that goes quiet. These things tell you what passed before you arrived."

"What if I can't see it?"

"Then you learn. Every day you look. Every day you see more." He glanced at me. "When I was your age, I saw nothing. My uncle had to point to tracks three times before I understood. Now I see them without thinking. Your eyes will learn."

The canyon narrowed. We moved through dappled shade where cottonwoods grew near a seep in the rock. Water trickled, barely more than a whisper, into a shallow pool. My uncle knelt again.

Fresh tracks everywhere, pressed into mud. Deer had come here this morning, maybe just before dawn.

"She's close," my uncle said, his voice barely a breath. "Maybe bedded in shade. The sun is high. She'll be resting."

He tested the air, wet his finger, and held it up. "Wind is good. Coming toward us. She won't smell us if we're careful."

We moved like shadows then, slower than I'd ever moved. Each step took forever. My uncle's eyes swept the canyon ahead, reading the landscape the way my grandmother read the sky before rain. I tried to see what he saw: the dark spaces under overhanging rock, the thick brush where something might hide, the shimmer of heat on stone.

Then his hand touched my shoulder and squeezed. I looked where he was looking.

At first, nothing. Just rock and scrub and the hard bright air. Then I saw her.

A deer, the color of the canyon itself, lying in shade beneath a jutting shelf of stone. Her head was up, ears turned forward, listening. She hadn't seen us. Hadn't smelled us. But she knew something was different. Some animal sense was warning her.

My uncle's bow came up in one smooth motion. He drew the string back, the movement so slow it seemed like growing instead of pulling. The deer's muscles bunched. She was going to run.

The arrow flew.

It happened faster than I could follow. One moment, my uncle's bow was drawn, the next the arrow was gone, and the deer was on her feet, leaping. I saw the shaft buried behind her shoulder, saw her take three great bounds, then stumble. Then fall.

Then stillness.

My uncle lowered his bow. He stood for a long moment without moving, his eyes on the place where the deer had fallen. Then he walked forward, and I followed, my heart hammering in my chest.

She lay on her side, the arrow deep, her eyes already glazing. She was beautiful. Her coat was smooth, the color of sunset on canyon walls. Her hooves were small and perfect. Blood darkened the earth beneath her.

My uncle knelt beside her and placed his hand on her neck. He spoke in Yavapai, words I knew were important even though I'd never heard them before. He thanked her for her life. He asked her spirit to forgive him for taking it. He promised nothing would be wasted.

Then he looked at me.

"She died so we can live. Remember that. Every part of her is a gift."

I nodded, my throat tight. I wanted to look away from the blood but couldn't. This was life and death together, wrapped up in one moment. Food and grief. Necessity and gratitude.

"Touch her," my uncle said. "Know what you're eating. Know what it costs."

I reached out and laid my hand on her side. Still warm. Still soft. I could feel where her breathing had stopped, where the life had run out of her like water from a broken pot.

"Good," my uncle said. "Now help me."

He showed me how to work. How to pull the arrow free, careful not to break the shaft. How to begin the field dressing, opening her belly with his stone knife, removing the organs we wouldn't eat. He did most of it, his hands quick and sure, but I helped where I could. Holding, steadying, watching.

The work was hard, bloody, and necessary. This was how we survived. Not from stores or markets, but from the land itself, from animals who gave their lives so we could eat.

When the deer was field-dressed, my uncle tied her legs together and hoisted her across his shoulders. She was heavy. I could see the weight in the way he shifted, finding balance.

"Can you carry the bow?" he asked.

Pride swelled in my chest. I took the bow, felt its weight, the smoothness of the wood. My uncle's weapon, trusted to me.

We walked back toward camp. The sun was past its height now, beginning its long fall toward the western mountains. My uncle moved steadily despite the deer's weight. He didn't complain. Didn't stop to rest. This was what men did. They hunted. They carried. They provided.

"Did you see the shot?" he asked after a while.

"Yes."

"Where did the arrow go?"

I thought back, trying to picture it. "Behind the shoulder."

"Why there?"

"I don't know."

"The heart and lungs. Quick death. If you shoot too far back, the animal suffers. Too far forward, you might only wound it. Behind the shoulder, angled toward the far shoulder, that's the kill shot. Remember."

"I will."

"Someday you'll make this shot. Someday you'll carry deer to feed your family. But first you learn to see. Learn to track. Learn to move quiet. The shooting is last."

"When can I practice with the bow?"

He smiled. "Soon. Your father is making you a small one. But first, the tracks. Can't shoot what you can't find."

We walked in silence for a time. Then he said, "You did well today. Kept quiet. Paid attention. Your grandmother will be pleased."

"Will there be enough for everyone?"

"For tonight, yes. And some to dry for later. The whole camp will eat."

I thought about that. One deer, shared among all the families. Everyone would have a little. The hunter gained prestige, but the meat belonged to the community. That was the way. That was how we survived together.

When we came down into the canyon where our camp lay, people saw us coming. Children ran to meet us, Nashta among them, her eyes wide at the deer across my uncle's shoulders. The men came next, helping him lower the deer to the ground near the butchering area. The women gathered, already planning how to cook it, what parts to dry, what to eat fresh.

My grandmother stood near the fire, watching. When I came to her, she touched my head.

"You went with your uncle."

"Yes."

"What did you learn?"

"How to see tracks. How to follow. How to..." I paused, trying to find words for the feeling of my hand on the deer's warm side. "How to be grateful."

She nodded slowly. "Then it was a good day."

My father appeared, carrying the bow he'd been working on. It was smaller than my uncle's, the wood still pale and new. Not finished yet, but taking shape.

"Soon," he said, seeing me look at it. "A few more days and you can practice."

My uncle was surrounded by the other men now, telling the story of the hunt. I heard him describe the tracking, the careful stalk, the shot. He didn't mention me by name, but when he said, "The boy did well," my father's hand touched my shoulder.

That night we ate deer meat roasted over the fire. The smell filled the canyon, rich and savory. My uncle got the heart, as was proper. The hunter who made the kill got first choice, though he could share it if he wished. He cut it into pieces and gave some to my father, some to the elders, some to me.

"Eat," he said. "It will make you strong. Make you brave."

The meat was dense and dark, iron-tasting, warm from the fire. I chewed slowly, feeling the strength of it, the life passing from the deer into me. Around the fire, people talked and laughed. Grandmother was singing, her voice carrying the story of a hunter from the old days. The children chased each other between the wickiups, their bellies full.

This was what the deer had given us. Not just food, but this: togetherness, story, life continuing.

I fell asleep that night thinking about tracks in the dust, about the arrow flying true, about my hand on the deer's warm side. In my dreams, I walked the canyon with my uncle, following signs only I could see. The land spoke and I understood its language. I was learning to see.

I was learning to be Yavapai.

And I didn't know that everything I was learning would soon be something I could only remember. I didn't know that the tracks I learned to follow would become tracks in memory, the stories my uncle told would become stories I told myself in the dark, alone.

For now, I was just a boy who'd gone hunting with his uncle. Who'd carried the bow back to camp. Whose belly was full of deer meat and whose heart was full of pride.

For now, that was enough.
