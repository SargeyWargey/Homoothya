# Chapter 16: The Whispers

The men came back wrong.

My father and uncle returned to camp when the sun sat low, but they didn't carry deer or rabbits or even stories about what they'd seen. They came back quiet, their faces hard in a way that made my stomach tighten.

I'd seen my father look like that once before. The day he came back alone, without my first mother.

I was smaller then. Maybe four winters, maybe five. Too young to understand what death meant, but old enough to know something terrible had happened.

She'd gone out that morning with the other women to gather agave hearts near Mormon Flat. I remembered watching her leave, the digging stick across her shoulder, her gathering basket empty and waiting to be filled. She'd touched my head as she passed. That was all. Just her hand on my hair, warm from the cooking fire.

She never came back.

Father found her in the afternoon. The other women came running into camp ahead of him, crying, and then father appeared carrying her. Her body was wrong. Limp. Her head rolled against his shoulder in a way that frightened me. I tried to go to her but my aunt held me back.

"Soldiers," someone said. The word hissed through camp like wind through dry grass.

They'd found the women gathering. The white men had shouted things in their language, words my mother didn't understand. When she couldn't answer, when she reached for her digging stick not knowing they thought it was a weapon, they shot her.

She'd been gathering food. That was all.

I didn't cry at first. I thought she was sleeping, thought father would lay her down and she would wake up. I kept waiting for her to move, to speak, to look at me with those eyes that had always been warm.

But she didn't move. Didn't speak. Didn't look.

They wrapped her in hides and took her away to the burial place. I wasn't allowed to go. Too young, they said. Stay with your aunt, they said.

Father came back different. The softness gone from his face. His mouth a hard line. His hands always near his weapons. At night I heard him talking with the other men, his voice low and angry. "Bitter vengeance," my uncle called it later, when he thought I wasn't listening. "Your father has bitter vengeance for soldiers and all white people now. Because of what they did to your mother."

I understood the anger even if I didn't understand death. The soldiers had taken her. Had hurt her for no reason. Had made father's face turn to stone.

After many moons, my father took a new wife. A woman from another family whose husband had died the winter before. She was kind to me, gentle, and in time I learned to call her mother too. She gave my father two daughters—Nashta first, then the baby. She did the work my first mother had done: grinding meal, gathering plants, making our clothes. She cared for me when I was sick. She smiled when I climbed too high in the mesquite trees.

But she wasn't the same. Couldn't be. And father never lost that hardness, that readiness for violence that had settled into him the day the soldiers killed my first mother.

Now, watching him return to camp with that same terrible look on his face, I felt my stomach clench. The soldiers were close again. And father remembered, just as I did, what they had already taken from us.

The woman who had become mother to me stood from the grinding stone, my baby sister on her hip. "What is it?"

My father looked at her for a long moment before speaking. "Tracks. Boot tracks. Three men, maybe four. Following the river upstream from the east."

"How close?"

"Two valleys over. Half a day's walk."

The other women had stopped their work. Everyone was listening now. My grandmother's hands went still on the basket she was weaving.

"Could be prospectors," one of the men said. "Looking for silver."

"Or scouts," my uncle said. His jaw was tight. "Looking for us."

My father set his bow down carefully, like it might break. "We saw their camp. Old, maybe three days. They'd stayed there, built a fire, left marks on trees." He paused. "They're looking for something. And they're not trying to hide."

That night, the adults talked in voices that rose and fell like the wind. I lay under my blanket with Nashta curled against me, pretending to sleep, but I heard everything.

"We should move higher." That was my uncle. "Into the mountains. Make it harder for them to follow."

"Winter is coming." An aunt's voice, worried. "The high country will be too cold. And we haven't finished gathering enough. We're already low on meat."

"How low?" My father's voice was sharp.

"Two days, maybe three if we're careful. We'll need to hunt soon."

"Can't hunt if we're running," someone said.

"Better cold and hungry than dead."

My mother's voice cut through, sharp. "Don't say that in front of the children."

"They need to know what's happening."

"They're too young."

"They're old enough to run."

Silence then. Long and heavy. Nashta's breathing changed, and I knew she was awake too, listening. Her hand found mine under the blanket and squeezed.

My father spoke next, quieter. "We don't know they're looking for us. Could be miners. Could be surveyors for the railroad they talk about."

"You believe that?"

Another pause. "No."

Grandmother's voice came from the darkness. "There have been soldiers in the territory for two winters now. More every season. They build their forts. They bring their hunters and their guides. They say we raid their settlements."

"We haven't raided anyone in months," someone said.

"Doesn't matter what's true. Matters what they say is true."

I heard my father move, probably standing. "Tomorrow we'll send scouts south, toward the settlements. See if there are more soldiers moving. If they're organizing."

"And if they are?"

"Then we move. Take what we can carry. Find somewhere they can't follow."

Somewhere they can't follow. The words settled in my chest like stones.

---

Three days later, my father left before dawn with two other men. They didn't say where they were going, but I knew. Down toward the white settlements. To watch. To see what was coming.

My uncle taught me to make arrows while they were gone. We sat in the shade of the ramada, and he showed me how to split the shaft, how to fit the stone point, how to bind it with sinew soaked in water that would shrink tight as it dried.

"You have to make the binding perfect," he said. "If it comes loose, you lose the point. Lose the point, you lose the shot. Lose the shot, you go hungry."

My fingers were clumsy. The sinew kept slipping.

"Try again."

I tried. Failed. Tried again.

"Good," he said finally, examining my work. "Better. The binding will hold."

"When will father come back?"

My uncle didn't answer right away. He turned the arrow shaft in his hands, checking the straightness. "When he knows what he needs to know."

"What if the soldiers find him?"

"He's careful. He knows how to move without being seen."

"But what if they do?"

My uncle looked at me then, really looked at me. "Then we'll know they're close. And we'll run."

"Where would we go?"

"There are places. Caves in the high country. Canyons where the soldiers' horses can't follow. We know this land. They don't. That's our strength."

I thought about that. About running. About leaving this camp where I'd climbed mesquite trees and learned to pound meal and watched my uncle's arrow fly true. The thought of leaving made my throat tight, but I didn't cry. I just kept working the sinew around the arrow shaft, making the binding tight.

Nashta came running up, breathless. "Grandmother wants you."

We followed her to where grandmother sat with the other elders near the cooking fire. They were talking in low voices, but they stopped when we approached.

"Hoomothya." Grandmother gestured me closer. "Sit."

I sat.

She studied my face for a moment, then said, "Your mother tells me you've been asking questions. About the soldiers. About what might happen."

I nodded.

"Good. A boy who asks questions learns to see what's coming." She paused. "I'm going to tell you something, and I want you to remember it. Can you do that?"

"Yes, grandmother."

"The white men who come to our land, they don't see it the way we do. To them, it's empty. They think because we move with the seasons, because we don't build stone houses and cut the earth with plows, that we don't belong here. That the land belongs to no one."

She picked up a handful of dirt and let it sift through her fingers.

"But we've been here since the beginning. Since the First People emerged from the underworld. This desert, these mountains, these rivers—they know our names. The mesquite recognizes our hands. The deer know our prayers. We belong to this land the way the saguaro belongs to it. We're rooted here."

She looked at me hard. "The soldiers don't understand that. They can't. So they see us as something in the way. Something to be moved."

"But we won't move," I said. "Will we?"

Grandmother's face softened. "We'll do what we must to survive. Sometimes that means staying. Sometimes it means running. Sometimes it means fighting. But no matter what happens, you remember: you are Yavapai. You are Kwevkepaya. This land is your blood. Even if they force us away, even if they try to make us forget, you carry it inside you. They can't take that."

I didn't understand everything she meant. I was too young. But I felt the weight of it, the importance. So I nodded.

"Say it," she said. "Tell me who you are."

"I'm Hoomothya. I'm Yavapai."

"Again."

"I'm Hoomothya. I'm Yavapai. I'm Kwevkepaya."

"Good. Don't forget."

---

My father came back on the fifth day.

He looked exhausted. Dust covered him from head to foot, and there were dark circles under his eyes like he hadn't slept. But it was his face that scared me. The hardness in it. The way his mouth was a thin line.

The men gathered immediately. The women pulled the children close but didn't send us away. We needed to hear this.

"There are soldiers," my father said. "Many of them. Camped three days' walk from here, maybe less on horseback. I counted more than a hundred soldiers. Maybe one hundred twenty. And they have Native scouts with them—many scouts. Pima. Maricopa. Maybe some Apache. As many scouts as soldiers, maybe more. They're organizing for something. Preparing."

"For what?" someone asked, though we all knew.

"For us."

"Our own people," my uncle said bitterly. "Pima and Maricopa, working for the Army against us."

"Old enemies," an elder said quietly. "The soldiers use our conflicts against us. Promise them payment, food, weapons. Turn tribe against tribe."

My father nodded. "I saw them training together. The soldiers and the scouts. They're preparing to sweep the territory. Looking for every band, every camp."

My mother's hand tightened on my shoulder.

"There's talk in the settlements," my father continued. "I listened outside a trading post, heard men talking. They say the Yavapai have been raiding. Killing settlers. Stealing cattle. They say General Crook has orders to pacify the territory. That means kill or capture anyone who won't go to the reservation."

"We haven't raided," my uncle said.

"Doesn't matter. Some band did, somewhere. Or they say some band did. To them, we're all the same. All hostile. All Apache."

"We're not Apache," someone said angrily.

"They don't care about the difference."

The silence that followed felt like the air before lightning strikes. Heavy. Electric.

Finally, one of the elders spoke. "What do you think they'll do?"

My father looked around at all of us. At the wickiups and the grinding stones and the children sitting close to their mothers. At the life we'd built here in this canyon.

"I think they'll come looking. I think they'll sweep through the territory, checking every canyon, every water source, every place we might camp. And when they find us..." He stopped. "We can't be here when they come."

"Where do we go?"

"The cave."

Everyone knew which cave he meant. The one in Salt River Canyon, high on the north wall. Difficult to reach, easy to defend. A place we'd used before when danger came.

"It's defensible," my uncle said, nodding slowly. "They can't approach without us seeing them. Can't bring horses up that climb. If we have enough food and water, we can wait them out."

"Or they'll trap us there," an aunt said quietly.

"Better than being caught in the open."

The adults argued for a while, their voices rising and falling. But I could tell the decision was already made. We were going to the cave. We were going to hide.

I looked at Nashta. Her eyes were wide, scared. I reached over and took her hand again, the way she'd taken mine that first night when we listened to the adults talking about running.

My mother knelt beside me. "It's going to be all right," she said.

I wanted to believe her. Wanted to feel safe in the certainty of her voice. But I'd seen my father's face. I'd heard what he wasn't saying.

Nothing was going to be all right.

---

We started packing before dawn.

The wickiup came down fast, the poles and brush that had been our home for three moons reduced to bare earth in less than an hour. My mother moved through the space where our sleeping area had been, her hands quick and sure, gathering what we'd take and leaving what we couldn't carry.

"Only what you can hold," she told me. "Your blanket. Your second pair of sandals. The small waterskin."

I looked at the bow my father had been making for me. It wasn't finished yet, the wood still pale and rough in places. But it was mine. Or would have been.

My father saw me looking. He picked it up, ran his hand along the shaft. "Next time," he said. "When we come back, I'll finish it."

"When will we come back?"

He didn't answer.

Around us, the whole camp was dissolving. Burden baskets appeared, quickly filled. The grinding stones were too heavy to take, so the women wrapped them in brush and buried them in shallow pits, marking the spots so we could find them again when we returned.

When we returned. Everyone said it like it was certain. Like this was just another migration, another move from one camp to another following the seasons.

But I knew it wasn't. This felt different. Felt permanent in a way that made my chest ache.

Grandmother was wrapping dried meat, packing it carefully in layers with juniper leaves to keep it fresh. She worked steadily, her hands never stopping, but her face was distant. Remembering, maybe. Or praying.

"Can I help?" I asked.

She looked up. "Take this." She handed me a small bundle wrapped in hide. "Carry it carefully. It's precious."

I took it. Light, but something hard inside. "What is it?"

"Seeds. Mesquite, agave, squawberry. If we have to plant new, somewhere else, we'll have them."

Somewhere else. The words hung in the air between us.

"Grandmother, are we coming back?"

She stopped working. For a long moment she just looked at me, and I saw something in her face I'd never seen before. Uncertainty. Fear.

Then she reached out and touched my cheek. "I don't know, child. I don't know."

That scared me more than anything else. More than the talk of soldiers. More than my father's hard face. Because grandmother always knew. She knew when rain was coming. Knew which plants would bear heavy. Knew the stories and the songs and the way things should be.

If she didn't know, we were truly lost.

By the time the sun cleared the eastern peaks, we were ready to go. Thirty-seven people: men, women, children, elders. Everything we owned on our backs. Everything we couldn't carry left behind.

My father stood at the front, his bow across his shoulders, his face set toward the north. Toward the Salt River Canyon. Toward the cave that might save us or trap us or both.

"We move fast," he said. "We rest when we must, but we don't stop for long. Stay together. Stay quiet. If I signal, everyone drops and hides. Understood?"

We understood.

My mother adjusted the burden basket on her back, the tumpline across her forehead. Nashta would walk beside her, holding the edge of her skirt. I would walk with the other boys my age, old enough to keep pace, young enough that we didn't carry as much.

My uncle came to stand beside my father. Together they looked north, toward the canyon that would be our refuge. Or our grave.

"Ready?" my father asked.

My uncle nodded.

We started walking.

Behind us, the camp sat empty. The cleared ground where our wickiups had been. The cold fire pits. The grinding stones buried like secrets. Everything we'd built, everything we'd been, reduced to marks on the earth that the next rain would erase.

I looked back once. Only once. Then I turned and followed my father north, toward the canyon, toward the cave, toward whatever was waiting for us there.

The whispers had become shouts. The fear had become flight.

And somewhere behind us, I knew, the soldiers were coming.
