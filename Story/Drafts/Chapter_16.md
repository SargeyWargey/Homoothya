# Chapter 16: The Climb

We walked for two days before I understood what fear really meant.

The first day was almost ordinary. We followed deer trails north through country I knew, passing landmarks I'd seen a hundred times. The twisted juniper that looked like an old man bending. The red rocks stacked like a giant's cairn. The spring where we always stopped to fill waterskins when we traveled this direction.

My legs ached from keeping pace, and the small bundle grandmother had given me grew heavier with each mile, but I didn't complain. No one complained. The adults set a steady rhythm and we followed it, children and elders alike, our feet finding the path by instinct.

We stopped once when the sun stood high, resting in the shade of a rock outcrop. My mother gave me dried meat and water. I chewed slowly, watching my father and uncle scan the horizon behind us, their eyes never still.

"Do you see them?" I whispered to my mother.

"Hush. Eat."

But I saw the tightness around her mouth, the way her hand kept touching the knife at her belt. She saw something. Or feared she would.

We moved again before I'd finished the meat.

The second day was harder.

The land changed as we climbed. The low desert gave way to rougher country, scattered juniper and scrub oak replacing the saguaro and mesquite. The air cooled. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of pine from somewhere higher, somewhere we weren't going.

We turned west into a canyon system I didn't know. The trails here were faint, barely visible, and sometimes my father stopped to study the ground before choosing which way to go. We were leaving the known paths. Going where travelers didn't go. Where pursuit would be hard.

That's when I started to feel it. Real fear. Not the worried kind that came from hearing adults talk in the dark. But the kind that lived in your belly and made your breath come short. The kind that came from understanding, finally, that we were prey.

Nashta felt it too. I could tell by the way she stayed close to mother, one hand always gripping fabric. She didn't run or play or even talk much. Just walked, her eyes too big in her thin face.

When we stopped that night, there was no fire. Too dangerous, my father said. The smoke could be seen from miles away. So we huddled in our blankets and ate cold food and shivered as the temperature dropped.

I lay between my parents, listening to the darkness. Strange sounds carried in the cold air. The yip of coyotes. The hoot of an owl. Something larger moving through brush somewhere down-canyon, its passage marked by the crack of breaking branches.

"Sleep, Hoomothya," my mother whispered.

I closed my eyes but didn't sleep. None of us really slept that night.

The third day we reached the rim of Salt River Canyon.

I'd never been here before. Never seen anything like it. The land just dropped away, the earth opening like a wound, revealing layered cliffs that fell hundreds of feet to the river below. The walls were gold and red and grey, ancient stone that made me feel small and temporary.

"There," my father said, pointing north along the canyon wall. "The cave is there. Two hours' walk, maybe three with everyone together."

I couldn't see any cave. Just cliff face and empty sky and the distant thread of the river far below.

We followed the rim north, moving slower now. The terrain was treacherous, loose rock and sudden drops hidden by brush. My grandmother needed help over the rough spots, and the smallest children had to be carried.

Finally we stopped. My father and uncle moved to the edge and looked down. When they came back, my father's face was grim.

"We have to descend here. The trail is steep. Everyone needs to be careful."

Trail was a generous word for what we found. It was barely more than a series of ledges and handholds carved into the cliff face, dropping from the rim into a tilted landscape of broken rock and scattered vegetation. Below that, I could see what might have been a lava bed, dark stone jumbled and sharp. And beyond that, set into the canyon wall maybe a third of the way down from the rim, a dark opening in the rock.

The cave.

My uncle went first, testing each step. Then my father. Then they called up the first group: three adults, strong and steady. They descended slowly, their bodies pressed close to the rock, hands gripping anything solid.

I watched them get smaller and smaller until they reached a wider ledge about halfway down. They waved. All clear.

My mother adjusted her burden basket, redistributing weight. "You're next," she told me. "Stay close to the wall. Don't look down. If you need to stop, stop. No shame in being careful."

My throat was too dry to answer. I just nodded.

When my turn came, I put my hands on the rock and started down.

The first few steps were the worst. The cliff face dropped away beneath me, and for a heartbeat I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. The world tilted. My fingers dug into stone.

"Keep going, Hoomothya." My uncle's voice floated up from below. "Just like climbing down from a mesquite tree. One step at a time."

I made my feet move. Found a crack for my toes. Shifted my weight. Moved my hand to a new grip. The rock was cold under my fingers, rough and solid. I focused on that. On the texture of stone. On the next handhold.

Don't look down. Don't think about the empty air behind you. Don't think about falling.

My foot slipped.

For a terrible instant I swung out from the wall, one hand the only thing keeping me from falling. Pebbles scattered, clicking against stone as they tumbled into emptiness. I heard my mother gasp above me.

Then my uncle's hand closed around my ankle, steadying me. "I've got you. Always three."

My toes scrabbled against rock. Found purchase. My weight came back onto the wall.

"Good. Keep coming."

I kept coming. Hand, hand, foot.

When I finally reached the ledge where my uncle waited, my legs were shaking so hard I could barely stand. He pulled me close, his hand on the back of my head.

"You did well. Brave."

I didn't feel brave. I felt like crying. But I swallowed it down and nodded.

One by one, the others descended. Some sure-footed, some terrified but determined. The women came down with burden baskets still on their backs, their balance perfect despite the weight. Grandmother came last among the elders, moving slowly but steadily, her old hands finding holds I couldn't see.

When everyone was on the ledge, we started across the lava bed.

The dark stone was razor-sharp in places, broken and jumbled like some ancient violence had shattered the earth and left the pieces where they fell. We picked our way through, trying not to cut our feet on the edges, trying not to turn an ankle in the gaps between rocks.

I heard one of the babies crying, the sound thin and lost in the vast space of the canyon. A mother hushed it, but the crying didn't stop. Just got softer, more resigned.

From the far side of the lava bed, we could finally see the cave clearly. It sat in the cliff face about a hundred and seventy feet above where we stood, a dark semicircle carved into pale stone. To reach it we'd have to climb again, up a steep slope of loose rock and dirt, then scramble up the last section to the cave's opening.

My father studied the approach, then looked back at all of us. Tired people. Scared people. Women and children and elders who'd already climbed more today than they should have to.

"Rest here," he said. "Drink. Eat something. Then we make the last climb."

I found a flat rock and sat, my legs grateful for stillness. My mother sat beside me and handed me the waterskin. The water was warm but I drank it anyway, feeling it ease my dry throat.

Around us, people settled into small groups. Quiet conversations, low-voiced. Someone was redistributing weight in the burden baskets, leaving the heaviest items here at the base to be carried up in stages. The men checked weapons, tested bowstrings, inspected arrows. My uncle unwrapped one of the three rifles our band had acquired through trade, precious things, kept for defense, never wasted on hunting when arrows worked just as well. He checked the ammunition, counted what little we had.

Preparing for siege.

Because that's what this was, I realized. We weren't just hiding. We were preparing to be trapped. To wait out whatever was coming.

I looked up at the cave mouth, dark against the pale cliff. From here it looked like safety. Like refuge. A place the soldiers' horses couldn't reach. A place we could defend. But even from this distance I could see the lie; it wasn't a cave so much as the mountain's cupped palm, a wide mouth with barely enough throat to swallow us. Shelter by name only, open to the sky, yet still the only ledge beyond the reach of horses.

But something about it made my skin prickle. Something about the way it gaped open, like a mouth waiting to swallow us.

"Hoomothya." My father crouched beside me. "When we get to the cave, you stay near your mother. Stay quiet. If I tell you to do something, you do it immediately. Understand?"

"Yes, father."

He studied my face. "You're doing well. Being strong. I'm proud of you."

The words made my chest tight. I wanted to be strong. Wanted to make him proud. But I was also terrified, and the effort of hiding it was exhausting.

"I'm scared," I said quietly.

"Good. Fear keeps you alert. Just don't let it make you freeze."

"How do you not freeze?"

He was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "You remember what you're protecting. You think about the people you love. And you decide their lives matter more than your fear."

I looked over at my mother, at grandmother, at Nashta sitting nearby with her mother. All of them trusting my father, trusting the men, trusting that this cave would keep them safe.

"Will the soldiers find us here?" I asked.

My father's jaw tightened. "I don't know. Maybe. But if they do, they'll have to come down that same cliff we just climbed. They'll have to cross that lava bed. They'll have to climb to the cave entrance while we're above them." He paused. "If they come, we have the advantage."

If. The word was supposed to be reassuring. But I heard what lay beneath it.

When.

---

We started the final climb as the sun began its descent toward the western rim. The slope was steep, the footing treacherous. Loose rock skittered away under our feet, tumbling down the incline and clattering against the lava bed below.

I climbed on my hands and knees in places, grabbing at scrub brush for handholds, digging my toes into the soft dirt. My breath came hard. The bundle grandmother had given me kept slipping, and I had to stop twice to retie it.

Above me, I could see people disappearing into the dark mouth of the cave. Their silhouettes vanished into shadow, swallowed by the stone.

When I finally pulled myself over the lip and into the cave, I had to stop and let my eyes adjust. After the bright canyon, the interior was almost black. Gradually, shapes emerged. People moving in the dimness. The curve of the cave ceiling, lower than I'd expected. The rough floor, uneven and dusty.

The space was bigger than it had looked from below—maybe sixty or seventy paces wide, but not deep. Forty feet at most from the entrance to the back wall. An alcove, really. A shelter, not a true cave.

But it would hold us all. That was something.

People were already organizing the space. The back wall for the elders and youngest children, the warmest spot farthest from the wind. The sides for families. The front, near the entrance, for the men who would keep watch.

My mother found a spot for us along the right wall. She set down her burden basket and immediately started arranging our belongings, creating a small territory in the larger space. My grandmother settled nearby, her back against the stone, her breathing labored from the climb.

I stood at the cave entrance and looked out.

The view was enormous. The canyon spread below, all red and gold stone layered like time itself. The river was a dark line far below, barely visible in the late afternoon shadows. The opposite rim caught the last sunlight, glowing like embers.

It was beautiful.

I could see the whole approach from here, the lava bed we'd crossed, the ledge where we'd rested, even part of the rim trail we'd descended. Anyone coming would be visible long before they arrived. We'd see them from miles away.

But they would see the cave too. A dark mark on the cliff face. Obvious, if you knew to look.

"Come away from the edge," my mother called. "Help me with this."

I turned back to the interior gloom and went to help her spread our blankets. Behind me, the canyon darkened as the sun fell. By the time full dark came, we'd made the space as livable as we could.

No fire tonight either. Too visible. So we sat in the cold and the dark and ate dried food and tried not to think about how exposed we were. How visible. How easy to find if someone was looking.

Around me, I could hear the sounds of seventy-six people trying to settle into stone. Babies fussing. Adults murmuring. The shuffle of bodies finding comfortable positions on hard ground. Someone coughing, the sound echoing off the cave walls.

I lay between my parents, wrapped in my blanket, and stared at the cave ceiling just barely visible above me. The stone was pale where the rock had flaked away, darker where smoke from old fires had stained it.

Other people had used this cave before us. Other Yavapai families, fleeing other dangers. I wondered if they'd felt this same fear. This same sense of being hunted.

"Sleep," my mother whispered, the same word she'd said every night of this journey.

I closed my eyes.

Outside, the canyon filled with darkness and silence. The kind of silence that feels like waiting. Like the whole world holding its breath before something terrible happens.

I slept fitfully, waking often to the sound of nothing. To the weight of stone above me. To the knowledge that we'd run as far as we could run, climbed as high as we could climb.

There was nowhere left to go.

This cave was our last refuge.

And in the darkness, I dreamed of soldiers climbing toward us, their boot prints clear in the soft earth, their rifles gleaming in the dawn light.

I dreamed of being found.
