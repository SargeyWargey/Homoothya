# CHAPTER 11: THE COUSIN

## Early 1900s

The letter arrived on a Tuesday in the spring when the cottonwoods along the Verde had just begun to leaf. I recognized the handwriting before I saw the signature. The script was precise, the kind that comes from years of writing prescriptions and medical notes. It was addressed to Mike Burns, Fort McDowell area, and the return address said Chicago, Illinois. I carried it to the shade of a mesquite tree before opening it.

"I have been searching for my Yavapai relatives," it began. "I believe you may be my cousin."

The name at the bottom stopped my breath. Wassaja. Carlos Montezuma. The infant they had pulled from beneath his mother's body after the cave went silent. The baby who survived because death had covered him with her own flesh. I had heard he lived. I had heard he became a doctor. But I never expected him to find me.

I read the letter three times before I folded it and placed it in my shirt pocket. My hands shook. For thirty years I had carried the memory of that day alone. Now someone who had been there, who had breathed the same air thick with gunpowder, who had lost family in the same moment, was reaching across the distance between Chicago and Arizona to say he remembered too.

Three weeks later I stood on the platform at the Phoenix depot and watched passengers step down from the eastbound train. I did not know what to look for. The last time I had seen Wassaja he was an infant wrapped in blankets, carried away by a Pima woman who had taken pity on him. The man who descended the steps wore a dark suit and carried a leather bag that marked him as a professional. His face was serious, his posture straight. When our eyes met, something shifted in his expression. Recognition passed between us without words.

"Mike," he said, extending his hand. His grip was firm, a doctor's handshake meant to convey competence and reassurance. But his eyes were wet.

"Wassaja," I answered. Then, correcting myself, "Carlos."

He shook his head. "Call me Wassaja when we are alone. That is the name my mother gave me before she covered me with her body."

We stood on the platform while other passengers moved around us. The depot smelled of coal smoke and hot metal. Somewhere a conductor shouted the departure time for the next train west. Wassaja set down his bag and reached for my shoulder. His hand rested there for a moment, and I felt the weight of everything he could not say and everything I could not either.

"I have looked for you a long time," he said finally. "I needed to find someone who was there. Someone who remembers."

We walked to a small restaurant near the depot where the owner knew me and did not object to serving Indians. Wassaja ordered coffee and I did the same. When the cups arrived, he wrapped his hands around the warmth even though the day was not cold. I watched him try to find the words.

"They took me to Chicago," he said. "A photographer bought me first. He dressed me in costumes and made me perform for crowds. Then a minister took me in and sent me to school. I studied medicine because I wanted to help our people. But I did not know where our people were. I did not know if any of them had survived."

I nodded. "I was taken too. Captain Burns kept me. He taught me English and sent me to Carlisle. I became a scout for the Army." The shame of it sat heavy in my throat. "I tracked Yavapai and Apache for the soldiers."

Wassaja did not flinch. "We both survived in the only ways we could."

"You became a doctor," I said. "That is something good."

He looked at me with an expression I could not read. "I worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs for eight years. I saw what they do to our people on the reservations. The sickness, the hunger, the way they treat grown men like children who cannot think for themselves. I left because I could not be part of it anymore. Now I have my own practice in Chicago. I treat anyone who comes to my door. But I am not home there. I have never been home anywhere since that day."

I understood without him explaining further. Home was a place we had lost before we were old enough to remember how to find it again. Home was the sound of our mothers' voices, the smell of cook fires in the evening, the shape of the land where we had learned to walk. Home was buried in a cave on the Salt River, and no amount of education or money or respectability could bring it back.

"I have been writing letters," Wassaja continued. "Trying to find family. I found the Dickens brothers, Charles and George. They survived the wars too. And now I have found you." He paused, studying my face. "Do you remember what happened? In the cave?"

The question carved a hollow space in my chest. I gripped the edge of the table and forced myself to meet his eyes. "I remember everything. I was seven years old. They made me lead them there. I did not know what they planned to do. When the shooting started, I heard my father's voice. My grandfather. My little brother. I heard them all die."

Wassaja closed his eyes. "I was too young to remember. I only know what others told me. That my mother covered me with her body and died trying to keep me safe. That a Pima woman found me afterward and carried me away." When he opened his eyes again, they were bright with unshed tears. "But you were old enough to see it. To know what was lost."

"I am the only one living to tell," I said. The words came out before I could stop them. They were the truth I had carried since that morning when I stood outside the cave and listened to my people die.

Wassaja leaned forward. "Then you must tell it. You must write it down so the white people know what their soldiers did. So our people's children will know what happened to us."

I shook my head. "I do not know how to write that story. Every time I try, the words stop in my throat."

"You learned to write at Carlisle?"

"Yes. I can read and write English. I keep records for the farmers here. I help write letters for people who cannot do it themselves."

Wassaja reached into his coat and pulled out a folded newspaper. He spread it on the table between us. It was a copy of something called Wassaja, a monthly magazine. His name was listed as the publisher. The articles inside spoke of Indian rights, the corruption of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the need for citizenship and fair treatment.

"I write this every month," he said. "I tell the truth about what the government does to our people. I call out the lies. Not everyone listens, but some do. The words have power, Mike. Your words could have power too."

"Who would read my story?" I asked. "Who would believe a Yavapai who worked as a scout?"

"That is exactly why they should read it. Because you have seen both sides. Because you know what the soldiers did and you know what our people suffered. Because you are the only one living to tell."

He reached across the table and gripped my hand. His fingers were strong, a physician's hands accustomed to setting bones and stitching wounds. "Do not write it for now. Write it for later. Write it for the children who will come after us. Write it so the truth does not die when we do."

I could not answer him. The thought of putting those memories onto paper felt impossible. But I did not pull my hand away. We sat like that while the restaurant filled with the lunch crowd and the noise of ordinary life continued around us. Two survivors holding onto each other across the wreckage of our childhood.

Later we walked along the canal that brought water to the fields near Fort McDowell. The reservation had been established just a few months before, after years of fighting to keep the land. Wassaja had been part of that fight. He had written letters to congressmen, to newspapers, to anyone who would listen. He had used his education and his position as a doctor to demand that the Yavapai be allowed to stay on their own land.

"This is not the Verde Valley," he said, looking out over the desert. "But it is Yavapai land. It is permanent. They cannot take it from us now."

I nodded, though the promise felt fragile. The government had broken every promise it had ever made to us. But Wassaja believed this one would hold, and I wanted to believe it too.

"I need your help," he said. "The government wants to move everyone to the Salt River Reservation. They say the land is better there, that there is more water. But I know what they really want. They want to take this land for themselves and push us onto smaller and smaller pieces of ground until we disappear."

"What can I do?" I asked. "I am just a laborer. I chop wood and dig ditches."

"You are more than that. You know the people here. You speak Yavapai and English. You can write. You can keep records and send letters. We need to document everything. Every promise the government makes, every lie they tell. We need proof."

I looked at him and saw the determination that had carried him from a cave floor to a medical degree. He had survived by learning everything the white world could teach him, and now he was using those tools to fight back. It was a different kind of resistance than my father had chosen, but it was resistance nonetheless.

"I will help," I said.

He smiled, and for a moment I saw the child he must have been before the massacre. "Good. We will keep McDowell land and Verde River water. We will make sure our people have a place to live. And someday, when you are ready, you will write down what happened in that cave. You will tell the story that no one else can tell."

I did not promise him that. I could not. But I took the newspaper he offered me and folded it carefully. When I returned home that evening, I placed it in the wooden box where I kept important papers. Underneath it was a stub of pencil and several sheets of blank paper I had saved from the agency store. I stared at them for a long time before closing the lid.

Wassaja stayed for a week. We rode together to visit the Dickens brothers and other Yavapai families who had found their way back to the Verde region. Some of them remembered him as the infant who survived. Others had only heard the stories. All of them welcomed him as family. He examined sick children without charging a fee. He wrote letters on behalf of elders who could not read or write. He attended meetings where men argued about water rights and grazing permits. Everywhere he went, he told people the same thing. Hold onto the land. Do not let them move you again. Fight with paper and law and every tool the white man has given us.

On his last evening before returning to Chicago, we sat outside my small house and watched the sun set behind the mountains. The sky turned orange and purple, the colors deepening as darkness approached. Wassaja was quiet for a long time, and I thought perhaps he had fallen asleep. But then he spoke.

"I think about her sometimes. My mother. I do not remember her face, but I remember warmth. Safety. And then nothing. Just the stories other people told me." He turned to look at me. "You remember your mother?"

"Yes," I said quietly. "She was killed by soldiers near Mormon Flat. That is why my father brought us to the cave. He wanted revenge on the white men who murdered her."

Wassaja nodded slowly. "So we are both orphans twice over. Once when we lost our mothers. Once when we lost our people."

"We are not orphans anymore," I said. "We have found each other."

He smiled, but it was a sad smile, the kind that acknowledges a truth too painful to celebrate. "Yes. And we will make sure no one forgets them. Your writing and my advocacy. Two different paths to the same place."

When the train pulled away the next morning, I stood on the platform until the smoke faded into the distance. In my pocket was another copy of Wassaja magazine and a letter he had written urging the Yavapai at McDowell to resist any attempts at removal. I carried those papers home and added them to the box where I kept important things. The blank pages were still there, waiting. I did not touch them yet. But I thought about what Wassaja had said. Someday, when I was ready, I would write it down. I would tell the story that only I could tell.

The seed had been planted. It would take years to grow, years of living with the weight of memory, years of watching my people struggle to survive on land that should have been theirs by right. But the seed was there now, placed by the one person who understood what it meant to carry impossible memories into an uncertain future. My cousin, the doctor who had survived beneath his mother's body. My cousin, who believed that words could fight back against the silence that wanted to erase us.

I was not ready yet. But someday I would be. And when that day came, I would remember this moment. I would remember Wassaja telling me that my words had power. I would remember that I was not alone in carrying the truth. And I would write.
