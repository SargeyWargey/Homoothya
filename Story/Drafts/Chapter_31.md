# MIKE BURNS'S FINAL YEARS AND DEATH 

### 1923-1934
After Carlos died, Mike continued writing.

He had been trying to publish his manuscript for more than a decade. The historical record documents his persistent efforts and consistent failures:

In 1922, he gave a manuscript draft to Dr. William H. Seibert for editing. Seibert edited it but removed Mike's "charges against Anglos." This sanitized version was still rejected by publishers.

In spring 1929, Mike delivered another draft to Sharlot Hall, the Arizona territorial historian he had first contacted in 1910. She edited a few pages but was unable to find a publisher.

A partial account of Mike's life appeared in T. E. Farish's "History of Arizona" before World War I, but it was fragmentary, filtered through a white historian's perspective, stripped of its full power.

Throughout the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, Mike persisted. He revised. He sought help. He faced rejection after rejection. The message was consistent: publishers were not interested in the Indian perspective on what had been done to them.

On May 28, 1934, Mike moved to Mayer, a small town outside of Prescott. He was approximately 69 years old. His body carried the accumulated damage of nearly seven decades: childhood trauma, years of manual labor, the weight of witness.

Six months later, on November 26, 1934, Mike Burns died at the Fort Whipple hospital in Prescott, Arizona.

He was survived by his wife Chehata, whom he had married around 1888, and their six children: Solomon, Carlos, Katie, Charlotte, Lula, and Josie.

Mike was buried in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, in the same ground where Carlos Montezuma rested and where the bones from Skeleton Cave had been reinterred.

The manuscript he had spent decades writing, revising, and trying to publish went into the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott.
