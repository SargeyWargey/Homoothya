# EPILOGUE
## MIKE BURNS'S FINAL YEARS
### 1923-1934
After Carlos died, Mike continued writing.

He had been trying to publish his manuscript for more than a decade. The historical record documents his persistent efforts and consistent failures:

In 1922, he gave a manuscript draft to Dr. William H. Seibert for editing. Seibert edited it but removed Mike's "charges against Anglos." This sanitized version was still rejected by publishers.

In spring 1929, Mike delivered another draft to Sharlot Hall, the Arizona territorial historian he had first contacted in 1910. She edited a few pages but was unable to find a publisher.

A partial account of Mike's life appeared in T. E. Farish's "History of Arizona" before World War I, but it was fragmentary, filtered through a white historian's perspective, stripped of its full power.

Throughout the 1910s, 1920s, and early 1930s, Mike persisted. He revised. He sought help. He faced rejection after rejection. The message was consistent: publishers were not interested in the Indian perspective on what had been done to them.

On May 28, 1934, Mike moved to Mayer, a small town outside of Prescott. He was approximately 69 years old. His body carried the accumulated damage of nearly seven decades: childhood trauma, years of manual labor, the weight of witness.

Six months later, on November 26, 1934, Mike Burns died at the Fort Whipple hospital in Prescott, Arizona.

He was survived by his wife Chehata, whom he had married around 1888, and their six children: Solomon, Carlos, Katie, Charlotte, Lula, and Josie.

Mike was buried in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, in the same ground where Carlos Montezuma rested and where the bones from Skeleton Cave had been reinterred.

The manuscript he had spent decades writing, revising, and trying to publish went into the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott.

## THE SKELETON CAVE REMAINS
### 1923-1985
The bones Carlos and Mike retrieved were not the last to be recovered from Skeleton Cave.

In 1925, Mike made another journey to the cave, this time accompanied by a Maricopa County sheriff and several other Yavapai individuals. They collected more remains, continuing the work of bringing their ancestors home.

The main reinterment took place in 1933. The skeletal remains recovered from multiple trips to Skeleton Cave were laid to rest in a mass grave in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell. One grave for the approximately 80 people killed on a winter morning sixty years earlier.

The grave had no marker for decades. The dead rested in their own land, finally, but in silence.

On Memorial Day 1985, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation held a service and dedicated a tombstone over the mass grave. Norman Austin, then tribal president, spoke clearly: "The record has never been set straight. The victims were Yavapais, not Apaches."

Even in death, even after a century, the fight for accurate witness continued.

## CARLOS AND MIKE'S SHARED LEGACY
Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns represented two paths toward the same goal: Indigenous survival, sovereignty, and witness.

Carlos used the education forced upon him at the Indian School in Illinois to become a physician. He graduated from the University of Illinois, then Northwestern Medical School. He practiced medicine in Chicago, serving both white and Native patients. He used his platform to publish Wassaja magazine from 1916 to 1922, calling for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and demanding Native American citizenship and self-determination. He co-founded the Society of American Indians in 1911. He wrote, spoke, and challenged federal Indian policy in public forums that few Native people could access.

Mike used his education at Carlisle Indian School and his bitter experience as an Army scout to become a witness. He chose documentation over activism, testimony over speeches. He spent decades writing his account, attempting to get it published so that the Yavapai perspective would be heard. He registered to vote in 1908, becoming the first Native American registered voter in Arizona Territory, asserting citizenship on his own terms.

Together with other Yavapai leaders, including Charles and George Dickens, Carlos and Mike worked to establish Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land.

The reservation was officially established by executive order on September 15, 1903. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the order creating 24,680 acres from abandoned Fort McDowell Military Reserve land. This victory secured a land base for Yavapai people who had been imprisoned at San Carlos Reservation for 25 years following the 1875 March of Tears.

The irony was stark and bitter. The reservation was carved from the military post that had served as a base for operations against the Yavapai people, including the Skeleton Cave Massacre.

Their homeland stolen, their families murdered, their children taken to boarding schools designed to kill their culture, and finally, they won the right to live on land named after the fort that had coordinated their destruction.

It was a victory. It was also a wound that would never fully heal.

## THE MANUSCRIPT'S SILENCE
### 1934-2000s
After Mike's death in 1934, his manuscript was preserved in the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona.

Sharlot Hall, the woman Mike had first contacted on January 6, 1910, seeking publication help, had kept his papers. She died in 1943, nine years after Mike. The manuscript remained in the museum's archives, occasionally consulted by researchers but unpublished.

Seventy-six years passed from Mike's death in 1934 to the first publication in 2010, seventy-six years of silence.

During this time, mainstream Arizona histories continued to describe the Skeleton Cave incident, when they mentioned it at all, from the Army's perspective. A battle against hostile Indians. A necessary engagement. Casualties regrettable but justified. Some accounts inflated the threat posed by the Yavapai or minimized the number of women and children killed. Others simply omitted the event entirely, erasing it from the historical record.

Mike's eyewitness testimony, the only firsthand survivor account, remained unknown to the general public. Students in Arizona schools learned about pioneers, cavalry, and the taming of the West. They did not learn about Hoomothya, the boy who watched his family massacred. They did not learn about Mike Burns, who spent his life trying to make them listen.

The name "Skeleton Cave" itself tells part of this story.

After the 1872 massacre, the bodies of victims were left in the cave. Between 1905 and 1908, rancher Jack Adams, led a group to the site. A photographer named Lubken took pictures of the remains still scattered across the cave floor. These photographs circulated. The site became known as Skeleton Cave, the name entering maps and local lore.

The name referred to physical evidence, the bones visible to visitors. But for decades, the full story of what happened there on December 28, 1872, remained obscure. The bones spoke, but the context, the humanity, the truth from the Yavapai perspective stayed buried.

Worse than silence, the site was looted.

From 1905 to 1911, during Roosevelt Dam construction, the cave was desecrated. Artifacts and human remains were removed as souvenirs. In 1984, a Phoenix outdoor writer was photographed with illegally taken material from the site. Metal detectors were used. The cave floor was dug down three feet or more, treasure hunters searching through the grave of nearly 80 people.

The site was not protected as a sacred place or massacre location until much later. This desecration continued for decades, another layer of violence against the Yavapai dead.

## PUBLICATION
### 2010-2012
Around the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars working in the Sharlot Hall Museum archives recognized the extraordinary significance of Mike Burns's manuscript.

Here was a firsthand account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre. Here was testimony about forced assimilation, Army scout service, the March of Tears, the struggle for citizenship, and land rights. Here was the voice of a survivor who had spent his life trying to be heard.

In 2010, "All My People Were Killed: The Memoir of Mike Burns (Hoomothya) A Captive Indian" was published by Sharlot Hall Museum Press. Dr. John Langellier and Dr. Sandra Lynch served as editors, preparing the manuscript for publication while preserving Mike's voice.

The publication came exactly one hundred years after Mike first wrote to Sharlot Hall seeking help. January 6, 1910, to 2010. A century of waiting.

In 2012, a second publication followed. "The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian" was published by the University of Arizona Press. Gregory McNamee spent seven years compiling and editing the manuscript, providing historical context while centering Mike's own words.

Mike's children did not live to see his work published. They died without knowing that their father's testimony would eventually reach the world, that his decades of effort would bear fruit.

His manuscript had waited a hundred years to be heard.

## CHANGING THE RECORD
Mike Burns had written in 1913: "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

As the only known firsthand survivor account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his testimony carries unique historical authority. Military records document the attack from the Army's perspective: troop movements, casualty counts, tactical decisions. But Mike's manuscript provides what official records cannot: the experience of being forced to guide soldiers to his family's hiding place, the sound of gunfire echoing in the cave, the sight of soldiers rolling boulders over the edge to crush people trying to escape, the brutality of Pima and Maricopa scouts in the aftermath, the human cost measured not in statistics but in the faces of the dead.

With the publication of Mike's testimony, historians and the public finally had access to the Yavapai perspective on Skeleton Cave.

Military reports had claimed a justified engagement against hostile combatants. The official casualty count varied: some reports said 54 dead, others 76. All downplayed or ignored the presence of women and children.

Mike's account revealed families sheltering in a cave. Women grinding corn. Children huddled in fear. Approximately 80 people were dead by the time the shooting stopped, most of them noncombatants. Soldiers deliberately using ricochet fire off cave walls to multiply the killing. Boulders rolled to crush those trying to flee. Bodies piled at the cave entrance.

The narrative has shifted in historical literature and public understanding. Museums have updated their exhibits. Textbooks have revised their accounts. Historical markers have been changed or removed. The Yavapai perspective, carried by Mike's testimony, has forced a reckoning with the reality of what happened on December 28, 1872.

The language has changed from "battle" to "massacre." The victims are increasingly recognized as Yavapai, not generically as "Apache." The number of dead is acknowledged as far higher than early reports claimed. The presence of women, children, and elders is centered rather than minimized.

This change matters. Language shapes memory. Memory shapes how we understand ourselves and our history. For more than a century, the dominant narrative allowed Americans to see Skeleton Cave, if they saw it at all, as a regrettable but necessary military action. Mike's testimony makes that narrative impossible to sustain.

One witness changed the record.

## THE ONGOING STRUGGLE
The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation continues on the reservation established in 1903. The current size is approximately 24,000 acres with around 950 community members.

Before European contact, Yavapai land stretched across millions of acres of central Arizona: the Verde Valley, the Mogollon Rim, the Salt River Canyon, the Superstition Mountains, and the Bradshaw Mountains. Seasonal camps, hunting grounds, gathering sites, and sacred places spanning a geography larger than some eastern states.

Now: 24,000 acres.

The Verde River and Salt River water sources remain contested. The Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990 secured water rights that should never have been in question. But urban development, agricultural interests, and mining operations continue to threaten access, requiring constant vigilance more than a century after Mike and Carlos fought to preserve Fort McDowell.

Ancestral Yavapai lands remain in federal, state, or private hands. Sacred sites, including Skeleton Cave itself, are not under Yavapai control. The people must ask permission to visit places that were theirs for thousands of years.

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation maintains cultural programs to reclaim what boarding schools like Carlisle attempted to erase. Language revitalization teaches young people the Yavapai language that Mike lost as a child and spent his adult life relearning. A tribal museum preserves Yavapai history. A youth drum group keeps traditional songs alive. Cultural practitioners teach basket weaving, food preparation, and seasonal ceremonies.

Every ceremony, every word spoken in Yavapai, every child taught traditional ways is an act of resistance against the cultural genocide that Carlisle and the reservation system were designed to accomplish.

Contemporary Yavapai people continue to document ongoing challenges: environmental destruction from mining and development, bureaucratic neglect and broken promises, threats to sovereignty, the slow violence of poverty, and inadequate healthcare. New generations of advocates, writers, and activists carry forward the work Mike began. They refuse to let their history be erased.

## FULL CIRCLE
Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns achieved remarkable things: securing Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land in 1903, documenting their people's history, and creating legal precedents that continue to benefit the Yavapai people today. Mike's manuscript eventually reached publication, forcing a reckoning with historical truth.

Yet both men died before seeing Mike's words published. Carlos in 1923, less than a month after retrieving bones from the Cave. Mike in 1934, after decades trying to get his testimony heard. Neither held the published book. Neither saw historians change their accounts based on his testimony.

More than 150 years after the Skeleton Cave Massacre, the Yavapai people continue fighting for recognition, resources, and respect.

Mike Burns wrote so that future generations would know the truth. That truth is not merely historical but present. It lives in ongoing Indigenous struggles for sovereignty, in fights to protect water and land, in efforts to preserve languages targeted for extinction, in the daily resistance of Indigenous people asserting their right to exist, to be heard, to control their own futures.

Mike's witness reminds us that genocide is not a single past event but an ongoing process requiring constant resistance. His testimony calls us to see through the line from Skeleton Cave to contemporary struggles, to understand that historical justice requires present action.

At the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, three graves connect past and present:

Carlos Montezuma, the physician and activist who fought for his people until tuberculosis claimed him.

The mass grave of Skeleton Cave victims, reinterred in 1933, contains approximately 80 Yavapai who died on December 28, 1872.

Mike Burns, the witness who spent his life making sure the world would know what happened.

The cemetery connects the cousins in death as they were connected in life, linking them to the ancestors they fought to honor. Yavapai people continue to visit, to remember, to carry forward the work of witness.

Mike's testimony is no longer silent. His words are published, studied, cited, and remembered.

Mike Burns was the only one living to tell what happened to his people on that December day in 1872. But his witness has multiplied. Every person who reads his words, every historian who corrects the record, every student who learns the truth, every Yavapai who carries forward his legacy becomes part of that witness.

The story does not end with publication. It continues in the ongoing struggle for justice, recognition, and the right to exist on their ancestral land.
