# PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS BEGINS

**Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona**
**1920**

The blank pages stare at me like the past waiting to swallow me whole.

I sit at my table as the afternoon light slants through the window, turning the dust in the air to gold. My hands rest on either side of the paper: weathered hands, scarred knuckles, fingers that know the weight of a rifle and the shape of mesquite beans. Hands that have written letters for my people to the Indian agents, that have signed my name at the polling place, that have held this pencil a hundred times trying to find the first word.

Today I will write it.

I have seen things others did not survive to tell.

That is why I must write this. Not because I want to; the wanting died a long time ago. I write because I owe this story. I owe it to the ones who fell silent. I owe it to my people, whose voices were drowned in gunfire and the lies that followed. I owe it to my cousin Carlos, who has spent his life fighting with newspapers and standing on platforms I will never reach.

But I am not Carlos. I am Mike Burns, and all I have is this: my witness, my words, and the terrible clarity of being the one who lived.

Carlos showed me that our voices matter. That our stories can reach beyond the reservations where they have tried to bury us. That the White People need to hear what they have done, not from their generals and their historians, but from us. From the ones who bled.

So I will write.

I will start with the day I became Mike Burns. The day Captain James Burns took me into his household.

I will write about the boy the captain brought home. The servant. The ward. The one who who slept in the corner of military quarters, who watched and listened and survived.

What came before is buried. Buried in a cave in the Salt River Canyon. Buried with all the others.

But I can write this story. How I survived. How I lived in two worlds and belonged to neither. How I learned to read and write so that one day, this day, I could set down the truth.

The White People have heard only one side. They have heard about the savage Apaches, the dangerous Indians, the necessary pacification. They have heard their generals' reports, their soldiers' stories, their satisfied accounts of civilization's triumph.

They have not heard from us.

I pick up the pencil.

This will be published. The White People are not all the same; some of them want to hear the truth. They are beginning to question the stories they were told. Beginning to ask what was done in their names.

I will give them an answer. I will tell them what I witnessed. What I endured. What I became.

I will write this so that my people's truth does not die with me. So that someone, someday, will read these words and know: we were here. We lived.

I bend over the page and begin to write the story of Mike Burns, the adopted Indian, the educated scout, the man who walked between two worlds and found home in neither. I will write about Captain Burns and the years that followed. I will write about survival and compromise and the cost of living when all your people are gone.


Today I write: *Mickey*

The pencil moves across the page, leaving its trail of graphite and memory. Outside, the desert evening settles over Fort McDowell, over the Verde River that runs past like a whispered promise. The children have gone inside. The light is almost gone.

But I am still here, still writing, still bearing witness.

The only one living to tell.
