# PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS BEGINS

**Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona**
**1920**

The blank pages stare at me like the past waiting to swallow me whole.

I sit at my table as the afternoon light slants through the window, turning the dust in the air to gold. My hands rest on either side of the paper: weathered hands, scarred knuckles, fingers that know the weight of a rifle and the shape of mesquite beans. Hands that have written letters for my people to the Indian agents, that have signed my name at the polling place, that have held graphite a hundred times trying to find the first word.

Today I will write it.

I have seen things others did not survive to tell.

That is why I must write this. Not because I want to; the wanting died a long time ago. I write because I owe this story. I owe it to the ones who fell silent. I owe it to my people, whose voices were drowned in gunfire and the lies that followed. I owe it to my cousin Carlos, who has spent his life fighting with newspapers and standing on platforms I will never reach.

But I am not Carlos. I am Mike Burns, and all I have is this: my witness, my words, and the terrible clarity of being the one who lived.

Carlos showed me that our voices matter. That our stories can reach beyond the reservations where they have tried to bury us. That the White People need to hear what they have done, not from their generals and their historians, but from us. From the ones who bled.

So I will write.

The only one living to tell.
