# PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS

## May 1934, Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona

The paper waits. White, blank, accusing. I've sharpened three pencils and placed them in a row beside the stack of pages. The morning sun comes through the window and makes the paper almost too bright to look at. My hand, liver-spotted and swollen at the knuckles, hovers above that first page.

I am sixty-nine years old. I have been dying slowly for years now. The pain in my chest comes more often, stealing my breath when I bend to tie my shoes or when I wake in the night. My body knows what my mind has accepted: there is not much time left.

For forty years I have carried these stories. For forty years I have tried to tell them. I have written to editors, to publishers, to anyone who might listen. I helped Captain Bourke with his book—he promised me money. The book sold. I never saw a cent. I gave my manuscript to Dr. Corbusier. He removed the parts that made white people uncomfortable, then sent it to publishers anyway. They said no. Every time, they said no.

But the stories will not die with me. They cannot. I am the only one living to tell.

So I begin again, here, in this small house at Fort McDowell, with these pencils and this paper. I begin because I must.

But where to begin?

Not the beginning. Not yet. I cannot face that yet.

I will begin with my life as Captain Burns's servant. Yes. That is where I can start. December 22, 1872, when they found me alone in the rocks, nearly frozen, abandoned by my uncle. I was seven years old—or perhaps eight, I do not know my exact age. The soldiers pulled me from the rock hole. I fought them. They were stronger.

That is a beginning I can tell.

Before that... before that there was another life. Another name. Another world. But I am not ready to write about the boy who lived in that world. Not yet. Perhaps I will never be ready.

I pick up the first pencil. The lead leaves a gray line across the white page:

*My name is Mike Burns. I will tell you how I came to live with the American soldiers, how I learned their language and their ways, how I went to their schools and rode in their campaigns. I will tell you about the Yavapai people, about the country we lived in, about the food we gathered and the songs we sang.*

*I will tell you what the soldiers did. What the government promised. What was taken.*

I stop. My hand is shaking. The letters blur.

What I will not tell you—not yet, perhaps never—is what happened to the boy I was before Mike Burns. What happened in those six days between December 22 and December 28, 1872. What I saw on the morning of the twenty-eighth. What I heard. What I still hear in dreams that wake me gasping.

That boy died. Mike Burns lived. That is all anyone needs to know.

But even as I write these words, I know they are a lie. A partial truth. The white people have heard only one side of the story, I wrote to Miss Hall all those years ago. But I am doing the same thing now, aren't I? Telling only one side. The side I can bear.

I set down the pencil. Outside, I hear Chehata talking to the chickens in Yavapai. Her voice is steady, familiar, the sound of home. She is the one who helped me remember the language I had lost. She is the one who taught me the stories her grandmother knew, the old ways that were almost forgotten. Without her, I would have nothing to tell. Without her, I would have disappeared completely into Mike Burns and never found my way back.

But I have not found my way all the way back. Not to the beginning. Not to *him*.

I look at the paper again. The first sentence sits there: *My name is Mike Burns.*

Is it? Is that my name? Or is it the name they gave me after they took my real name away?

I am seventy years old. I have lived as Mike Burns for sixty-two of those years. Longer than I lived as... as the boy I was before. Mike Burns is who I am now. Mike Burns is who will tell this story.

But there are other stories too. Stories that belong to my people. Stories from the old women, from the medicine men, from the time before the soldiers came. Chehata's grandmother told me about the migrations, about the sacred places, about why we lived where we lived. Her mother taught me the songs for gathering mesquite, the prayers for the first rain. I have written these things down in other notebooks, scattered words and fragments. Someone needs to preserve them. When I am gone, who will remember?

So I will write two things. I will write my life—the life that can be told, the life that starts with Captain Burns. And I will write the knowledge that was given to me, the stories entrusted to me. I will write until I cannot write anymore.

What I will not write—what I cannot write—is the story of the boy who died in the cave.

Not yet.

Maybe never.

I pick up the pencil again. My chest aches. Time is short. I must write what I can while I still can.

*I will begin with my life as Captain Burns's servant.*

That much I can do.

The rest—the screams, the blood on the cave walls, the silence after the war songs stopped, the face of my baby sister, the weight of my grandfather's hand before it went slack—the rest will stay locked inside. Some doors cannot be opened. Some words cannot be spoken. Some truths break you when you try to tell them.

Outside, a mourning dove calls. The sound reminds me of the Salt River Canyon, of mornings when the canyon walls held the bird songs like cupped hands. My homeland. The place I said goodbye to when I was ten years old, when they marched us away to San Carlos. *Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land.*

But I did come back. Not to the Verde Valley, not to the Salt River Canyon. But to Fort McDowell, to Yavapai land, to my people. After all those years with the soldiers, after Carlisle and Kansas, after riding against my own people as a scout—after all of that, I came back.

And now I will write. I will write until my hand gives out or my heart gives out, whichever comes first.

I will write the story I can tell.

And the story I cannot tell—the boy, the cave, the morning everything ended—that story will have to wait. Perhaps it will wait forever. Perhaps some stories are too heavy to carry from the inside of your chest onto a white page. Perhaps some truths can only be lived, not written.

But I have to try. I am the only one living to tell.

Even if I tell it incomplete. Even if I tell it wrong. Even if I can only tell half of it, the bearable half.

I am the only one.

The pencil touches paper. The words begin.

*December 22, 1872. The soldiers found me in a rock hole on the side of Four Peaks Mountain...*

And just like that, I am back there. Seven years old. Freezing. Alone. About to become someone I did not choose to be.

I write until the sun moves across the floor and Chehata calls me to eat. I write until my hand cramps and the words swim. I write myself back into that winter day sixty-two years ago, when Hoomothya ended and Mike Burns began.

But I do not write about the boy who was Hoomothya. I do not write about his mother, about his father, about the little brother and sister he took care of after his mother was killed. I do not write about the mesquite harvests or the hunting lessons or the songs his grandmother sang.

Not yet.

Not yet.

The paper waits for that story. It has waited forty years. It can wait a little longer.

First, I will write the story of Mike Burns. The story of survival. The story of learning English and wearing uniforms and riding with the Fifth Cavalry. The story of Carlisle and Kansas and coming back to find my people scattered and broken and still here.

That story I can tell.

The other story—the one about the boy in the cave—that one will have to wait until I am strong enough. Or desperate enough. Or close enough to death that it doesn't matter anymore what it costs me to tell it.

I set down the pencil. My hands are shaking again.

Chehata appears in the doorway. She looks at me with eyes that have seen me through forty-six years of marriage, through poverty and grief and broken promises. She knows what I am trying to do. She knows what I am avoiding.

"Are you writing?" she asks in Yavapai.

"I am writing," I say.

"Are you writing *all* of it?"

I do not answer. She knows the answer.

She comes to stand behind my chair, rests her hand on my shoulder. "The children should know," she says. "Our grandchildren should know. All of it. Not just the part that doesn't hurt."

"It all hurts," I say.

"Then write the hurt," she says. "Write it so they know what was taken. Write it so they know what we survived."

She leaves me there with the paper and the pencils and the truth I am not ready to tell.

Outside, the sun is moving toward afternoon. Shadows grow longer. Time is running out.

I am the only one living to tell.

But I am not ready. Not yet.

So I will write what I can. I will write Mike Burns's story, and I will write the Yavapai stories that were given to me, and I will leave the hardest story for last. Maybe I will die before I get to it. Maybe that would be easier.

But the paper waits. And somewhere inside me, the boy I was—the boy called Hoomothya, the boy who died on December 28, 1872—somewhere inside me, he is waiting too. Waiting for me to be brave enough to speak his name. Waiting for me to tell what happened to him.

Waiting to be remembered.

Not today. I am not strong enough today.

But soon. Before I die. Before it is too late.

I will tell it all.

I am the only one living to tell.

And I will not—I cannot—die with this story still locked inside.

The pencil waits in my hand. The paper waits on the table. The truth waits in my chest like a stone, like a scream, like sixty-two years of silence.

Soon.

I will tell it soon.

But first, I will write the bearable parts. I will begin with December 22, 1872. I will begin with the boy in the rock hole who became Mike Burns.

And someday—before I die—I will go back further.

I will go back to the beginning.

I will speak the name I have not spoken aloud in sixty-two years.

I will write about Hoomothya.

The boy who died so Mike Burns could live.

The only one left to tell.

*To be continued...*
