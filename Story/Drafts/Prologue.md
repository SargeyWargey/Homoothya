# PROLOGUE: THE WITNESS BEGINS

**Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona**
**1920**

The blank page stares at me like the mouth of a cave.

I sit at my table as the afternoon light slants through the window, turning the dust in the air to gold. My hands rest on either side of the paper—weathered hands, scarred knuckles, fingers that know the weight of a rifle and the shape of mesquite beans. Hands that have written letters for my people to the Indian agent, that have signed my name at the polling place, that have held this pencil a thousand times trying to find the first word.

Today I will write it.

My body protests the stillness. The chair is hard beneath me, and my back carries its familiar ache—the settled pain of fifty-five years lived in a body that has bent to survive. I shift my weight, and something in my ribs catches and releases. These are the wages of endurance. The price of being the only one.

Outside, children are playing. I hear their laughter, high and bright, and for a moment I am somewhere else, someone else. Then the sound fades, and I am here again. At this table. With this page.

I can read. I can write English. Learned it at Carlisle, where they cut my hair and dressed me in stiff uniforms and told me I must kill the Indian to save the man. But the Indian would not die. He lives in me still, in the words I whisper when no one can hear, in the way I see the desert, in the weight I carry.

I have seen things others did not survive to tell.

That is why I must write this. Not because I want to—the wanting died a long time ago. I write because I owe this story. I owe it to the ones who fell silent. I owe it to my people, whose voices were drowned in gunfire and the lies that followed. I owe it to my cousin Carlos, who has spent his life fighting with newspapers and speeches, standing on platforms I will never reach.

Carlos fights from his doctor's office in Chicago, writing editorials, demanding justice, making the White People listen. He has given his life to this battle—educated himself in their schools, mastered their medicine, earned their respect, then turned it all against them. He speaks truth to their Senate committees. He publishes magazines that call out their lies.

But I am not Carlos. I am not a famous physician with a voice that carries to Washington. I am Mike Burns, and all I have is this: my witness, my words, and the terrible clarity of being the one who lived.

Carlos showed me that our voices matter. That our stories can reach beyond the reservations where they have tried to bury us. That the White People need to hear what they have done—not from their generals and their historians, but from us. From the ones who bled.

So I will write.

I will start with the day I became Mike Burns. The day Captain James Burns took me into his household, after—

No. Not after. Not yet.

I will write about the boy the captain brought home. The servant. The ward. The one who learned English and American ways, who slept in the corner of military quarters, who watched and listened and survived.

That is where the story begins. Where Mike Burns begins.

What came before—that is buried. Buried in a cave in the Salt River Canyon. Buried with all the others. I cannot write about that. Not yet. Perhaps not ever.

But I can write this story. The story of how I became Mike Burns. How I survived. How I lived in both worlds and belonged to neither. How I learned to read and write so that one day—this day—I could set down the truth.

The White People have heard only one side. They have heard about the savage Apaches, the dangerous Indians, the necessary pacification. They have heard their generals' reports, their soldiers' stories, their satisfied accounts of civilization's triumph.

They have not heard from us.

Until now.

I pick up the pencil. My hand is steady despite the years, despite the weight. I have chopped wood to feed my family. I have tracked through mountains and deserts. I have written letters and petitions and pleas. My hand knows how to work.

I write the first line: *In the winter of 1872, I came to live with Captain James Burns of the United States Army.*

It is not the whole truth. But it is the beginning of the truth I can tell. The truth about Mike Burns—the boy who learned to speak English, who went to Carlisle, who became a scout, who voted, who lived.

The other truth, the one about Hoomothya, the Yavapai boy who gathered mesquite beans and heard his grandmother's stories and knew the names of all the plants—that boy is silent. That boy died in December of 1872, even though his body kept breathing.

I am not ready to speak his name.

But I am ready to tell how I survived.

The afternoon light is fading now, turning the room amber and gold. Soon it will be evening, and I will put down my pencil and eat the simple meal I have prepared. Tomorrow I will pick up the pencil again. And the day after that. For as long as it takes.

This will be published. It must be. Carlos has shown me that change is possible, that our testimony matters. The White People are not all the same—some of them want to hear the truth. They are beginning to question the stories they were told. Beginning to ask what was done in their names.

I will give them an answer. I will tell them what I witnessed. What I endured. What I became.

I will write this so that my people's truth does not die with me. So that someone, someday, will read these words and know: we were here. We lived. We loved. We were human beings, and they slaughtered us, and one of us survived to tell.

I am the only one living to tell.

So I will tell.

I bend over the page and begin to write the story of Mike Burns—the adopted Indian, the educated scout, the man who walked between two worlds and found home in neither. I will write about Captain Burns and Carlisle and the years that followed. I will write about survival and compromise and the cost of living when all your people are gone.

And perhaps, if I can find the courage, I will write about what came before. About the boy I was. About the family I lost. About the cave.

But not today.

Today I write: *In the winter of 1872, I came to live with Captain James Burns...*

The pencil moves across the page, leaving its trail of graphite and memory. Outside, the desert evening settles over Fort McDowell, over the Verde River that runs past like a whispered promise. The children have gone inside. The light is almost gone.

But I am still here, still writing, still bearing witness.

The only one living to tell.
