# Chapter 19: Taken

The scout who held me said something to the others. They laughed. One of them kicked my uncle's body to make sure he was dead.

Then a white officer stepped into the firelight. Tall, with markings on his shoulders that meant he commanded. He looked down at my uncle's body, then at me. Studied me. Made a decision.

He said something to one of the scouts in English. The scout turned to me and spoke in broken Yavapai, words I could barely understand.

"Where. Your. People."

I shook my head. I didn't understand. Or maybe I understood too well and didn't want to answer.

The scout grabbed my arm, squeezed hard enough to hurt. Asked again. "Where. Your. People. Hide."

He pointed at the darkness around us, made a sweeping gesture. Made a gesture like people hiding in a cave.

They knew we were hiding somewhere nearby. The fire had drawn them. Now they wanted me to tell them where the others were.

Where my father was. My mother. My sisters. Everyone.

I looked at my uncle's body. At the soldiers surrounding us, five, maybe six of them with their rifles and their Native scouts who'd killed one of their own people.

I was eight years old. I didn't understand politics or war or the weight of the choice I was making.

But I understood this: if I didn't tell them, they might kill me too. Just like they'd killed my uncle.

The scout holding me drew a knife. Put it against my throat. Asked again. "Where."

I felt the blade. Cold. Sharp.

The officer said something in English. The scout with the knife answered. They were arguing about something. About me.

Finally the officer made a gesture and the knife came away from my throat.

But the scout still held me. Still waited for an answer.

"Cave," I whispered in Yavapai. My voice so small I could barely hear it myself. Then, not knowing if they understood, I pointed. Toward where the canyon lay in the darkness. Toward where my father and mother and sisters slept, unaware.

Toward everyone I loved.

The officer spoke to his men. Two of them immediately moved off into the darkness—runners, going to bring the main force to converge on this area.

I'd saved my life.

And doomed everyone else.

But I wasn't done. The Pima scout grabbed me by the arm, hauled me to my feet. Spoke to the officer, gesturing at me, then at the darkness where I'd pointed.

The officer nodded. Said something sharp in English.

The scout turned to me. Gestures: pointing at me, then sweeping his hand toward the darkness. You. Show. Take us.

Terror flooded through me. Pointing from a distance wasn't enough. They wanted me to lead them. To take them right to my family.

I shook my head violently. "No. No, I told you. I showed you. No more."

The scout backhanded me across the face. The world exploded in stars and pain. When my vision cleared, he had the knife out again.

One of the scouts gestured at me, hands tracing a path, then pointing at his chest, then at me. Show us. Path. Then safe. Live.

I understood through their gestures. They were going to make me betray my family twice. Once with my words. Now with my feet.

They untied my hands but the Pima scout kept hold of my arm.

I looked at my uncle's body. He'd stayed silent. Died with honor.

I'd told them where the cave was. And now I was going to lead them there.

Hours passed in a nightmare. More soldiers arrived—a few at first, then more. They gathered in the darkness, quiet and efficient. Officers issued orders through the scouts. Weapons checked. Equipment readied.

As dawn approached, a different officer arrived—more markings on his shoulders than the others. The scouts seemed to defer to him more. They spoke briefly, the new officer looking at me once.

He looked at me like I was a tool. Something to be used and discarded.

They gave me a blanket as the temperature dropped toward dawn. I wrapped it around my shoulders but couldn't stop shivering. From cold. From knowing what came next.

I thought about running. But the scout's hand never left my arm. Thought about refusing. But the knife was always there, visible threat.

I was eight years old. Just a child who wanted to live.

Even if living meant this.

As gray light touched the eastern sky, one of the scouts came over. Through gestures, he made me understand: I would show them the way. Walk. They follow. When close, I stop. Stay back. Won't be hurt.

I understood. They were offering me a fiction. A story I could tell myself. That I was forced. That I had no choice.

But I'd already chosen. When I whispered "cave" instead of staying silent.

Now I just had to live with it.

As the full light of morning came, I realized what would happen next.

They would make me take them there. Make me guide them to the cave.

Make me lead them to my family.

The scout pulled me to my feet. Gestures: Time to go. Show the way.

I looked one last time at my uncle's body. At the man who'd taught me to hunt. Who'd died with honor.

Then I turned toward where the canyon lay in the distance.

Toward my family.

Toward everyone I loved.

I was about to become their guide. Their betrayer.
