# PUBLICATION 

### 2010-2012

Around the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars working in the Sharlot Hall Museum archives recognized the extraordinary significance of Mike Burns's manuscript.

Here was a firsthand account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre. Here was testimony about forced assimilation, Army scout service, the March of Tears, the struggle for citizenship, and land rights. Here was the voice of a survivor who had spent his life trying to be heard.

In 2010, "All My People Were Killed: The Memoir of Mike Burns (Hoomothya) A Captive Indian" was published by Sharlot Hall Museum Press. Dr. John Langellier and Dr. Sandra Lynch served as editors, preparing the manuscript for publication while preserving Mike's voice.

The publication came exactly one hundred years after Mike first wrote to Sharlot Hall seeking help. January 6, 1910, to 2010. A century of waiting.

In 2012, a second publication followed. "The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian" was published by the University of Arizona Press. Gregory McNamee spent seven years compiling and editing the manuscript, providing historical context while centering Mike's own words.

Mike's children did not live to see his work published. They died without knowing that their father's testimony would eventually reach the world, that his decades of effort would bear fruit.

His manuscript had waited a hundred years to be heard.
