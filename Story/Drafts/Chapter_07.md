# Chapter 7: Prisoner

They tied my hands.

Not tight enough to hurt, but tight enough that I couldn't slip free. The rope was rough against my wrists. I sat on a rock where they'd put me, surrounded by soldiers, and tried not to cry.

The officer who'd spoken to me—the one with the gold bars on his shoulders—stood a little way off, looking through a brass tube at the cave high above. Other soldiers were gathered around him, some standing guard, others checking weapons and equipment.

I counted twenty men. Maybe more. All of them bigger than my father. All of them armed with rifles and pistols and knives. All of them between me and home.

"Captain Burns, sir." One of the soldiers approached the officer. "What do you want us to do with the boy?"

So that was his name. Burns.

Captain Burns lowered the brass tube and looked at me again. I tried to meet his eyes without flinching, tried to show I wasn't afraid even though I was shaking.

"Keep him with us. Keep him quiet. He's our insurance."

"Insurance for what, sir?"

"For if they decide to fight instead of surrender." Burns turned back to study the cave. "A child in our hands might make them think twice about resisting."

My stomach twisted. They knew about the cave. They knew my people were up there. And they were planning something.

I had to warn them. Had to get away, get back up there, tell my father that soldiers were coming.

I stood up and tried to run.

I didn't make it three steps before hands grabbed me, lifted me off my feet, carried me back to the rock. A different soldier stood guard over me this time, his rifle resting in the crook of his arm, his eyes never leaving me.

"Stay put, boy," he said. Not unkind, but not friendly either. Just matter-of-fact. "You ain't going nowhere."

I sat. What else could I do?

The sun climbed higher. The morning grew warmer. The soldiers made no move toward the cave, just stayed hidden among the rocks below it, watching and waiting.

For what? I didn't know. But every minute that passed was another minute my family didn't know the danger they were in.

Captain Burns called some of his men together. They spoke in low voices, looking up at the cave, pointing to different parts of the cliff face and the approach. Planning. Strategizing.

I caught a few English words I'd learned from traders over the years. "Steep." "Difficult." "Approach." "Dawn."

Dawn. They were waiting for dawn. Tomorrow's dawn.

Which meant they weren't going to attack today. They were just going to wait here, keeping hidden, making sure no one in the cave knew they were here.

And I couldn't warn them.

I pulled against the rope on my wrists, but it held firm. The soldier guarding me noticed and shook his head.

"Don't hurt yourself, kid. Rope's not coming off till the Captain says so."

I looked up at the cave. I could see the entrance, that dark opening in the cliff face. If I looked carefully I could see movement there—small figures crossing in front of the entrance. My people, going about their day, unaware.

Was my father looking for me? Had they noticed I hadn't come back with the firewood? Were they worried?

Or did they think I'd just gone farther than I should have, lost track of time the way children do?

I hoped they were worried. I hoped they were searching. I hoped they would realize something was wrong and post more guards, prepare for attack, do something.

But the cave stayed quiet. No alarm was raised. Life went on up there while I sat trapped down here with the enemy.

One of the soldiers brought me water in a canteen. I drank because I was thirsty, even though I hated accepting anything from them. The water tasted strange, metallic, nothing like water from a yucca-fiber basket.

"You got a name?" the soldier asked.

I didn't answer.

"Don't talk much, do you?" He squatted down so he was at my eye level. He had a beard, brown with red in it, and kind eyes. "You're Yavapai, right? Or Tonto Apache?"

I stared at him.

"My name's Corporal Hayes," he said. "I got a boy about your age. Back in Ohio. He's probably playing in the snow right about now." He smiled, but it was sad. "I wonder if he remembers what I look like."

I didn't care about his son in Ohio. I didn't care about anything except getting back to my family.

Hayes stood up and walked away. Another soldier took his place as guard.

The day crawled past like something wounded. The sun crossed the sky so slowly I thought it might never set. The soldiers rotated guard duty, ate their rations, checked their weapons. Captain Burns stayed near the rocks, watching the cave through his brass tube, occasionally making notes in a small book.

I tried to memorize everything. How many soldiers. What weapons they carried. Where they positioned themselves. Anything that might help my father and the other men fight them off.

But what good would it do if I never got the chance to tell them?

Late in the afternoon, Captain Burns came and stood in front of me. I looked up at him, this man who held my life in his hands, and tried to see what kind of person he was.

His face was hard but not cruel. His eyes were tired. He looked like a man who'd done this before—captured people, made war, followed orders that maybe he didn't entirely believe in.

"I'm sorry about this," he said quietly. In English, so I didn't understand the words then. But I understood the tone. It wasn't exactly kind, but it wasn't harsh either. Just... weary. "This isn't personal. It's just war."

He walked away.

Just war. As if that explained anything. As if that made it right.

The sun finally set. The canyon filled with shadow, then darkness. The soldiers didn't light fires—didn't want to give away their position. They ate cold rations and spoke in whispers and settled in to wait through the night.

Someone untied my hands long enough for me to eat some of the hard bread they gave me. It tasted like sand and sawdust, but I was hungry enough to choke it down. Then they tied me again and made me lie down on a blanket they spread on the ground.

"Sleep if you can, boy," one of them said. "Tomorrow's going to be a long day."

I lay on my back and looked up at the stars. The same stars that were shining down on the cave where my family slept. The same stars I'd looked at every night of my life, stars that had always been there, constant and familiar.

But tonight they seemed farther away than ever. Cold and distant and indifferent to what was happening down here on the earth.

I thought about my mother. By now she must know I was gone. She must be frightened, searching, praying to whatever powers might listen to bring me back safe.

I thought about my father, who I'd seen transformed by grief when my first mother died. What would he do if something happened to me?

I thought about my sisters, who were too young to understand what war was, what soldiers were, what it meant that I'd disappeared.

I thought about Grandmother, who'd said the stone would shelter us. Who'd believed we'd be safe in the cave.

Had she been wrong? Or were the soldiers here for some other reason? Maybe they didn't even know about the cave, and this was all some terrible coincidence.

But I knew that wasn't true. I'd seen Captain Burns studying the cave through his brass tube. I'd heard the soldiers planning. They knew exactly where my people were.

And tomorrow at dawn, they were going to do something about it.

I tried to imagine what would happen. Would they attack? Try to negotiate? Demand surrender?

Whatever they did, my people would resist. My father and uncle and the other men wouldn't just give up. They'd fight to protect their families.

And people would die.

Maybe my father. Maybe my mother. Maybe my sisters.

Maybe everyone.

I rolled onto my side, curling into myself, the ropes cutting into my wrists. Silent tears ran down my face into the blanket.

I was seven, maybe eight years old. I didn't understand politics or military campaigns or the greater forces that had led to this moment. I just knew I'd been taken from my family and there was nothing I could do to help them.

Somewhere in the darkness, one of the soldiers was softly singing. A sad song in English, something about home and sweethearts and roads too long.

I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. But sleep wouldn't come.

***

They woke me before dawn.

The sky was still dark but beginning to gray at the edges. The soldiers were moving quietly, checking weapons, preparing for something.

Captain Burns stood over me. "Get up, boy. You're coming with us."

They untied my hands and pulled me to my feet. My legs were stiff from lying on the cold ground all night. They didn't retie me, but two soldiers stayed close on either side, ready to grab me if I tried to run.

We started up the slope toward the cave.

My heart hammered in my chest. They were taking me up there. Taking me back toward my family. Maybe this was my chance. Maybe when we got closer I could break away, run ahead, shout a warning—

"Don't even think about it," one of the soldiers whispered. "You make a sound before we're ready, and I'll gag you. Understand?"

I understood.

We climbed slowly, carefully, trying not to make noise. More soldiers were spreading out along the slope, positioning themselves below the cave entrance. Still more were climbing toward a position above the cave.

The sky was getting lighter. Soon the sun would rise. Soon people in the cave would start waking up.

I thought of my mother rekindling the morning fire. My father taking his position at the entrance to watch the canyon. My sisters stretching and rubbing sleep from their eyes.

None of them knowing that death was climbing toward them.

We were halfway up the slope when I saw the first movement at the cave entrance. A dark figure, silhouetted against the slightly lighter darkness inside. One of the sentries, probably.

He hadn't seen us yet. We were still in shadow, still hidden among the rocks.

Captain Burns raised his hand. The soldiers froze.

For a long moment nothing happened. The sentry stood at the cave entrance, just standing there, maybe looking out at the dawn, maybe thinking about breakfast, maybe worrying about his family.

Then he turned and went back inside the cave.

The soldiers started moving again. Closer. Quieter. Like wolves closing in on prey.

I wanted to scream. Wanted to shout a warning that would wake everyone in the cave, give them a chance to fight or flee or do something.

But a hand clamped over my mouth before I could make a sound. Strong arms held me immobile.

"Not yet," a voice whispered in my ear. "Not yet."

We kept climbing.

The sky grew lighter. The canyon rim caught the first sun, glowing gold. Any minute now the sun would reach down into the canyon, would illuminate the slope, would reveal the soldiers climbing it.

We were close now. So close I could see details of the cave entrance. Could see the smoke from morning fires starting to rise. Could hear faint sounds—voices, movement, morning sounds.

My people. My family. Alive and unaware.

I tried one more time to break free, to warn them. But the hands holding me were too strong. All I could do was watch.

Watch as the soldiers took their positions.

Watch as Captain Burns crept closer to the cave entrance.

Watch as the sun rose and the light came and the last peaceful morning of my people's life in that cave came to an end.

And I knew, even though I didn't know exactly what was going to happen, that I was watching the end of something. The end of safety. The end of hope. Maybe the end of everything.

They had caught us. And whatever came next would change my life forever.

I just didn't know yet how completely forever that would be.

The soldier's hand stayed clamped over my mouth.

The sun kept rising.

And six days from now, in this exact place, the world would end.

But first came the waiting. First came the terrible, helpless waiting.

And I, seven years old and frightened and alone, could do nothing but watch it come.
