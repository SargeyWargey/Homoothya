# Chapter 7: Prisoner

My father wouldn't look at me.

We sat on the cold ground as dawn approached, surrounded by soldiers preparing for something I didn't want to imagine. My father's hands and feet were still bound. So were mine. My uncle's body lay where he'd fallen, already stiffening in the cold.

I kept trying to catch my father's eye. Kept trying to make him see that I'd had no choice, that they would have killed him, that I'd only done what any child would do to save their parent.

But he wouldn't look at me. Wouldn't acknowledge me. His face was stone.

Maybe he wished they had killed him. Maybe that would have been better than knowing his son had betrayed his people.

The soldiers moved around us with purpose, checking weapons and equipment. The officer who'd questioned me—the one with gold bars on his shoulders—stood apart, looking toward the darkness where the canyon lay. Where I'd pointed.

Where my family slept.

"Captain Burns, sir." One of the soldiers approached him. "We ready to move out?"

So that was his name. Burns.

The captain nodded. "Leave two men here with the prisoners. The rest come with me. We'll approach from above, get in position before first light. When the sun rises, we'll have them outlined against the cave entrance."

The words were English, but I was starting to recognize some of them. "Cave." "Ready." "Move."

They were going. Going to the cave. Going to my people.

And I'd told them where to find them.

I made a sound, something between a sob and a moan. One of the soldiers looked at me but said nothing.

Captain Burns walked over and crouched in front of me and my father. He studied us for a moment, his face unreadable in the pre-dawn darkness.

"Keep them here until it's done," he said to the two soldiers he was leaving behind. "Don't hurt them unless they try to escape. The boy especially—he's just a child. He didn't know what he was doing."

But I had known. I'd known exactly what I was doing. I'd chosen my father's life over everyone else's.

And I would have to live with that choice forever.

The soldiers moved out, disappearing into the darkness. Twenty men, maybe more. All headed toward the cave. All because of what I'd told them.

My father finally looked at me then. His eyes were empty. Hollow. Like everything inside him had died when I'd pointed toward the canyon.

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "Father, I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do."

He looked away again.

The two guards stood a little distance off, rifles ready but not aimed at us. They talked quietly to each other, their voices low. Occasionally one would glance our way to make sure we hadn't moved.

Where would we go? My father was bound. I was bound. My uncle was dead. And somewhere in the darkness, soldiers were approaching the cave where everyone I loved was sleeping.

The sky began to lighten. Gray first, then pearl, then gold touching the eastern horizon. Beautiful. The kind of morning my grandmother would have called blessed. The kind of morning that made you grateful to be alive.

But this morning was death approaching. This morning was the end of everything.

I thought about my mother waking up in the cave, wondering where I was. Had she noticed I hadn't come back from the hunt? Was she worried? Or did she think I was with my father and uncle, that we'd stayed out overnight because the hunting had taken longer than expected?

I thought about my sisters. Little Nashta, who I'd promised to always protect. The baby who barely knew my name. Would they be frightened when the soldiers came? Would they understand what was happening?

I thought about Grandmother, who'd said the stone would protect us. Who'd believed we'd be safe in the cave.

She'd been wrong. And it was my fault.

Time crawled. The guards changed position, walking around to stay warm. One of them offered me water from his canteen. I drank because I was thirsty, even though I hated myself for accepting anything from them.

My father refused the water. Refused to eat the hardtack they offered. Refused to acknowledge their existence or mine.

The sun rose. Full light now. The guards looked toward the canyon, toward where their comrades had gone. Waiting for something. Listening for something.

And then we heard it.

Distant. Echoing off the canyon walls. But unmistakable.

Gunfire.

A few shots at first. Then more. Then a sustained roar that seemed to go on and on and on.

I tried to stand but my legs wouldn't hold me. I fell to my knees in the dirt, that terrible sound filling my ears, filling my chest, filling the whole world.

My father made a sound I'd never heard before. Animal. Wounded. A keening that came from somewhere deep inside him.

The gunfire continued. And continued. And continued.

How long does it take to kill seventy-six people trapped in a cave with nowhere to run? How many bullets? How many minutes?

Too long. Not long enough. An eternity. An instant.

When the shooting finally stopped, the silence was worse than the sound had been.

One of the guards looked sick. The other wouldn't meet my eyes.

We waited.

The sun climbed higher. The morning grew warm. Birds began to sing in the rocks around us, oblivious to what had just happened, to what we'd just heard.

It was mid-morning when the soldiers started coming back.

They climbed up from the canyon in ones and twos, their faces grim. Some of them wouldn't look at each other. One young soldier stumbled away from the group and vomited behind a rock.

Captain Burns came last. His uniform was dusty, his face drawn. He looked like he'd aged ten years since I'd seen him before dawn.

He walked over to where we sat and looked down at my father and me for a long moment.

"It's done," he said quietly. In English, but I understood the tone. "Seventy-six dead. All women, children, and old men. Not a single warrior among them."

My father stared up at him with murder in his eyes.

Burns turned to one of his officers. "Cut their bonds. We're taking them with us."

"Sir, wouldn't it be easier to—"

"We're taking them." Burns's voice was hard. Final. "The man and the boy both. That's an order."

Someone cut the ropes on my wrists and ankles. I rubbed feeling back into my hands, but I felt nothing. Numb. Empty. Hollow.

They untied my father too. For a moment I thought he might attack them, might go for their weapons and force them to kill him. But he didn't move. Just sat there, broken.

"Get them on horses," Burns said. "We're moving out."

They lifted me onto a horse, tied me to the saddle. Did the same with my father on another horse. Someone threw my uncle's body over a third horse like cargo.

The column formed up. Twenty soldiers, three prisoners—two living, one dead. And somewhere behind us in the canyon, seventy-six more dead left sealed in a stone tomb.

My people. My family. My mother and sisters and grandmother and everyone I'd ever known.

All dead because I'd been too young and too frightened and too human to stay silent when they threatened my father.

As we rode away from that place, I looked back once. Saw the canyon rim glowing in the midday sun. Saw the birds circling. Saw the country I'd been born in, the land my people had lived on since the beginning.

All of it going on without us. Without them.

The world didn't care that seventy-six people had died this morning. The sun still shone. The birds still sang. The rocks still stood eternal and indifferent.

Only I cared. Only I remembered. Only I was left to carry the weight of what had happened.

The only one living to tell.

And that burden was already crushing me.

My father rode ahead of me. His back was straight, his head high. Proud even in defeat. But he still wouldn't look at me.

I didn't know if he ever would again.

Captain Burns rode at the front of the column, his shoulders set, his face forward. The man who'd led the massacre. The man who'd kept me prisoner while my family died. The man who'd decided to spare my father and me when he could have killed us with the others.

Why? Why spare us? Why burden us with survival when death would have been kinder?

I didn't know then. I wouldn't know for years. Maybe I still don't know.

But as we rode north through the winter sunshine, away from the canyon and the cave and the dead, I understood one thing:

Hoomothya had died back there. The boy I'd been, the child who'd played and hunted and listened to Grandmother's stories—he was as dead as everyone else in that cave.

What rode on this horse was something else. Something broken and hollow and wrong.

A ghost.

A witness.

A traitor.

The only one left to tell what happened. The only one who would spend the rest of his life explaining to strangers how his people died.

How I helped kill them.

That weight settled on my shoulders as we rode, and I felt it crushing me, pressing me down into the horse's back, into the earth, into darkness.

But I didn't fall. I didn't break. Not yet.

I just rode.

And rode.

And rode.

Away from everything I'd been.

Toward a future I couldn't imagine and didn't want.

The only one living to tell.

**[End Chapter 7]**

*Word count: ~1,650*
*Scene location: Mesa above Salt River Canyon, then riding north*
*Approximate timeframe: December 28, 1872, the day of the massacre*
*Age: Hoomothya approximately 7-8 years old*

**Historical notes:**
- This revised version reflects Hoomothya's direct role in revealing the cave's location under duress
- The guilt and psychological burden of this choice would have been enormous for a young child
- Mike Burns's relationship with his biological father (if he survived the massacre) is not documented in historical sources—this version dramatizes a plausible emotional aftermath
- Captain James Burns did spare Mike and take him in as an adoptive son—the psychological complexity of this relationship, given Burns's role in the massacre, cannot be understated
- The massacre's casualty count of 76 (or varying numbers in different accounts) consisted primarily of women, children, and elders—a fact that haunted Burns and others who participated
