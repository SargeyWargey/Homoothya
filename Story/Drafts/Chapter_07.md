# 7  |  FAMILY

### 1889-1905
### Arizona reservations
Chehata told me at the start of the planting season that a new life had taken root inside the home we were still learning to share. We were turning earth for melons near the river when she paused, pressed her palm against her belly, and smiled with a certainty that stopped my breath. I had survived years by reading faint signs on the ground, but I had never read a sign that spoke of hope the way her smile did. The river breeze carried the scent of cottonwood buds, and for the first time since I left the Army, I let myself believe the coming year might give more than it took.

When the pains came that autumn, Hashduba sent for a midwife respected by every family along the river. The night was cold enough to fog the walls of our brush house, yet the room burned with cedar smoke and whispered prayers. I could not keep still. My hands remembered only how to pack a saddle or oil a rifle, not how to steady the woman I loved while she labored to bring our child into the world. Chehata gripped my fingers and told me to breathe with her. The midwife murmured in Yavapai, guiding her through wave after wave. Just before dawn, a cry split the darkness, thin at first, then fierce. The sound cut through the years of silence I had carried from the canyon to the parade grounds. The midwife laid a squalling boy on Chehata's chest, his skin slick with birth, his hair black and tightly curled. Tears stung my eyes in a way no wound ever had.

We named him Solomon for the ledger the agency clerk insisted on keeping, and Wi'itha for the name Chehata whispered while she wrapped him in a cotton blanket. Solomon for the record that would follow him whenever white officials demanded proof he existed. Wi'itha for the story he would hear at the fire, the story of a boy whose first breath was welcomed with songs that had survived soldiers, relocations, and hunger. I wrote both names carefully on a scrap of paper and tucked it in the small box where we kept our few treasures: pieces of turquoise, the silver brooch Chehata wore when we married, a pressed sprig of sage from the morning she told me she was with child.

Fatherhood demanded a vocabulary I did not yet have. Chehata's mother, Saha, sat with me during long afternoons while Solomon slept swaddled against her back. She taught me lullabies shaped like the river, each verse tied to the seasons. She corrected my pronunciation without embarrassment, tapping my chest when she wanted a deeper tone, smiling when the words finally rounded correctly. Sometimes she sang the same phrase again and again, telling me the meaning rested not only in the syllables but in how patiently they were carried. Solomon listened to both of us, and I realized we were learning together, father and son sharing the same classroom carved out of generations I had lost.

Work did not loosen its hold just because I had a child to cradle. I still rose before dawn to split mesquite or haul water for neighbors who could pay in beans or cloth. My hands blistered and healed, then blistered again. Yet every swing of the axe landed with purpose now. I was gathering more than firewood; I was gathering stories and songs to warm my family. When the agent cut rations, I took jobs guiding wagon trains across stretches of land I once scouted for the Army. The pay barely fetched flour and coffee, but each trip reminded me that the desert was still ours; however, the maps were redrawn.

Two winters later, another boy came crying into our home. We called him Carlos when we presented him to the superintendent and Mahkya when we wrapped him in a cradleboard decorated with abalone shells borrowed from Chehata's cousins. I had heard news of my cousin, Dr. Carlos Montezuma, through travelers who passed the trading post, each story painting him as a man who wielded education like a medicine staff. Naming our second son after him felt like a promise to bridge the distance between the paths we had taken. When I held baby Carlos close, I imagined writing to the cousin I had not seen since we were children, telling him there was a boy in San Carlos who carried his name like a drumbeat.

Daughters followed, each with her own rhythm. Katie arrived during a thunderstorm that rattled the walls. Charlotte took her first breath while the peach trees bloomed. Lula came breech, stubborn and strong, and Josie slipped into this world so quietly that Chehata had to coax her cry. We registered them with the names the clerk would recognize and gave them Yavapai names at our fire, names that tasted of mountains, rain, and the sharp sweetness of cactus fruit. At night, our home glowed with lamplight and the sound of small voices learning two languages at once. Their laughter tangled with the crackle of the fire like wind through willow branches.

The community watched us, curious and cautious. Some elders nodded when I offered my labor or shared the little English I had been forced to learn. They saw how I deferred to Saha and Hashduba, how I carried my children in cradleboards and taught them to step carefully around ceremonial objects. Others kept a distance. They remembered the scout who rode at the edge of their camps. I did not argue with their memories. When accusations pricked at my back, I bowed my head and kept working. Trust, like fluency, returned slowly. Chehata never wavered. When whispers grew sharp, she took my hand in view of everyone, reminding them of the man she had chosen.

After the children fell asleep and the fire thinned to embers, I opened the ledger I kept hidden beneath our blankets. I wrote the names of plants Saha catalogued for me, the verses Chehata taught while she patted cornmeal into cakes, the stories elders entrusted to our family because they wanted them remembered. Sometimes my hand hovered above the page, caught between the life I was building and the past I had tried to lock away. I could list medicines with ease, yet when I thought of the promise General Crook spoke at Rio Verde, my pen trembled.

One night, Chehata pressed her shoulder against mine and traced the ink stains on my fingers. “You write everything you learn from others,” she whispered. “Will you write what you carry alone?”

I stared at the empty column. “Some things are better buried.”

She shook her head gently. “Buried stories turn to sickness. Our people need to remember who broke us apart so our children will know why we hold each other so tightly now. Write about the promise. Write about the march. Let the words bleed here so they do not bleed inside you.”

Her voice steadied the air around us. I could feel the canyon walls of memory drawing close, the smoke, the frozen river, the boots marching toward San Carlos. “If I start,” I said, “I will have to see it all again.”

Chehata laced her fingers with mine. “You will not be alone. I will sit with you. When you are ready to tell the whole story, these pages will already be strong enough to hold it.”

I dipped the nib in ink. The first line shook across the paper, but it stayed: General Crook promised my people they could stay. Chehata covered my hand with her palm, anchoring me to the present while the past poured onto the page. In that moment, I understood that my ledger was more than a collection of lessons for the children. It was the beginning of a testimony I would one day owe to everyone who trusted me to speak.

As my children grew, I found myself called to mediate more often between the people and the agency. I wrote letters for Hashduba demanding fair beef allotments, for widows whose husbands had died hauling freight, and for young men arrested for leaving the reservation without passes. The agent's clerk sneered when I delivered petitions signed with names he could not pronounce, yet he read every word. I kept copies for myself, each letter a record of voices otherwise dismissed. My English, once a tool used against my people, slowly became a shield I could raise on their behalf.

Evenings belonged to instruction. Saha led us through the constellations, pointing out how the coyote shaped the sky. Chehata taught the children to grind corn on the metate, showing them how to keep the rhythm even so the meal would be fine. I sat beside them, copying phrases into a ledger I had purchased from the trader. Page after page filled with Yavapai words paired with the English terms that had replaced them in official reports. Wi'itha. Mahkya. Nahava for the smell of rain on dust. Tovokwe for the weight of grief that sits in the throat. I wrote not only for my children but for myself. Each word reclaimed was a stone laid back into the foundation of who I had been before soldiers burned my village.

We traveled whenever we could to visit relatives scattered by government orders. At Camp Verde, I stood on the riverbank with elders who remembered the march to San Carlos. At Salt River, I listened to families who had lost land to irrigation ditches carved for white settlers. We traded stories and seeds, promises and warnings. My children absorbed every lesson. They learned to greet each new campsite with gratitude, to leave offerings at springs, to listen when an elder spoke, even if the words came haltingly in English. They saw the cost of survival etched into faces lined by wind and worry, and they understood that our comfort depended on the resilience of those who kept walking when everything familiar was stripped away.

Around the turn of the century, rumors reached us that Fort McDowell might be reopened to Yavapai families willing to fight for it. The news stirred something restless in me. That land held the bones of my past, yet it also held the promise of water and fields our children could inherit. Chehata and I spoke late into the night, weighing the risks. Remaining at San Carlos meant enduring another generation under the thumb of officers who still considered us prisoners. Moving north meant facing memories I had locked away. We decided we would not let fear choose for us. We began to make trips to the Verde River, joining work parties that cleared irrigation ditches choked by years of neglect. My sons carried shovels shorter than their arms. My daughters gathered mesquite beans and sang to keep the little ones out of the canal.

During those trips, I began to write more than vocabulary lists. I sketched the outline of ceremonies, noted the stories elders entrusted to me, and recorded the names of the canyons we passed. I kept the ledger hidden beneath our bedding, not because I feared my family would object, but because the act of writing felt like holding an ember that could either warm or burn. Sometimes I woke before dawn, careful not to disturb Chehata, and added a line about the way my mother's voice used to braid through the morning. Other times, I forced myself to write about the march to San Carlos, describing the blistered feet of children and the way the soldiers laughed when elders stumbled. The words left me shaking, yet I understood that if I did not secure them on the page, they would vanish like footprints in the wind.

My children started asking questions I had avoided. Solomon wanted to know why some elders refused to sit near me at council fires. Carlos asked why I had two names when most men had one. The girls wondered why I flinched when I heard sudden gunshots from the distant gunnery range. I answered carefully, giving them pieces of the truth without dragging them into the pit of memory. I told them I had once carried a rifle for the Army because I believed it might protect families from worse harm. Chehata listened, her hand resting on my knee, trusting that when the time was right, I would finish the story.

By 1903, small caravans of our people started turning north toward the Verde. Families left San Carlos in the dark to avoid the officer who kept the pass ledger, trusting that the desert still remembered our footsteps. We traveled in clusters—elders in wagons padded with quilts, children riding bareback, young men walking the edges to keep watch for troopers who might send us back. At first, we stayed only a few weeks at a time, clearing brush from fields that had grown wild since the Army abandoned the post. But each trip stretched longer than the last. The river spoke the same language as the stories Saha told, and it called us home.

By the spring of 1905, most of the Yavapai families who dared to risk it were living at Fort McDowell again. We raised new brush houses beside the old parade ground and rebuilt headgates with mesquite trunks cut from the foothills. The women organized seed swaps so every garden carried something from each clan. The men took shifts on the ditch crews, and when the water flowed steady into the fields, we cheered like we had won a battle. Children chased each other between rows of corn sprouting in terraces our grandparents had carved, their laughter echoing against the ruined adobe walls the Army left behind.

Agents and surveyors rode up from Phoenix to see what we were doing. They expected to find vagabonds squatting on federal land. Instead, they saw orchards pruned, irrigation ditches running, and a council fire lit every evening. I greeted them in the uniform English the Army had taught me, then shifted to Yavapai so the elders could question every promise they made. I wrote the answers in my ledger, line after careful line: which tools they said they would send, which they withheld, which maps they rolled out showing our river feeding white fields downstream. Each note was proof. Each note was a warning.

We sent word to my cousin Carlos Montezuma anytime a trader or freighter headed North or toward Chicago. I told him which families had returned, how many acres we planted, which officials threatened us with removal if we did not register for allotments elsewhere. His replies arrived months later, their edges worn from travel, but his words still carried the same fire I remembered in his boyhood eyes. He wrote of laws we might invoke, allies he courted in Chicago, and the names of men in Washington who needed to hear that the Yavapai were back on the Verde and meant to stay.

Evenings belonged to the river. After the children fell asleep, I sat on the bank and let the water braid the day's labor into something steadier. The brush houses glowed behind me, smoke curling upward, the air thick with the smell of mesquite beans roasting. I kept my ledger open on my knees, adding Yavapai words beside the English ones the government insisted on. I wrote about the songs the women revived for the planting moon and the way the elders prayed over the ditch headgates before the first water was released. I wrote about the nervous glances we traded whenever riders approached from the south, unsure if they carried news or orders.

I could feel pressure building far beyond the river bend, Phoenix merchants hungry for our water, officials studying maps where our homeland was marked as surplus. The story waiting inside me no longer felt like a secret; it felt like a summons. I tucked the ledger beneath our bedding each night, knowing that sooner than later, a letter or a stranger would arrive demanding we justify our return. When that knock came, I meant to be ready with my family at my side, with our people rooted again at Fort McDowell, and with the words the future would need to hear.
