# 7  |  BECOMING ONE

### 1888
### San Carlos Reservation
We married after the spring planting, when the mesquite blooms perfumed the air and the nights carried enough warmth to gather beneath the stars. The ceremony took place in her family's camp. We stood beneath a canopy woven from willow branches while her aunt painted my cheeks with white clay. Hashduba placed a strand of shell beads in her hands and a strip of red cloth in mine. "You bind yourselves with these gifts," he said. "Remember that cloth can tear, beads can scatter. Hold them together." A Presbyterian missionary from the agency insisted on reading a verse from his Bible, but his words floated away on the wind. The vows that mattered were spoken in Yavapai, in the cadence of our ancestors. We circled the fire four times, stepping in rhythm with the drum her cousins beat. I felt the earth steady beneath my feet in a way I had not in years.

After the ceremony, we feasted on roasted agave, venison, and blue corn mush sweetened with saguaro syrup. Women sang Tolkepaya wedding songs that teased the groom for his clumsy feet. I laughed and accepted the jabs, because they were offered with affection that felt like sunlight breaking through clouds. Chehata and I sat close enough that our shoulders touched, and every time I leaned in to hear her over the drum, the copper beads brushed against my cheek. I wanted the night to stretch forever.

When the final song faded, her grandmother pulled me aside. Her hair was silver, her skin mapped with lines carved by sun and sorrow. "You carry the bones of another inside you," she whispered. "I hear it when you laugh. I see it in the way you hold your hands when you listen."

My breath caught. "I do," I said.

She nodded. "You do not have to speak of it to me. Just do not let it wither. Teach it to your children when they are ready. Let them know they come from more than one ridge."

Our first home as husband and wife was a wickiup her family helped us build near the riverbank, framed with willow poles and covered in willow-mesh mats. Rain drummed on the roof at night and lulled us to sleep. Days were busy with planting, hauling water, and the endless tasks of keeping a household upright on reservation dust. Yet even in exhaustion, a tenderness threaded through each moment. When I returned from the woodcutting crew, Chehata would press a tin cup of coffee into my hands and ask what stories I gathered that day. I told her about the Cibecue Apache singer who insisted the agent owed him two blankets, about the Maricopa trader who cheated everyone except the old women who shamed him into fairness. She listened and then told me stories she collected from her grandmother—tales of Spider Woman weaving dawn, of the water monsters who sleep beneath the Granite Dells. We traded narratives the way some couples trade gifts.

Language returned slowly, like a limb roused from numbness. Each morning before sunrise, Chehata and I recited the names of the surrounding hills. Then she would sing the lullaby I dimly remembered from childhood, the one about the quail leading her chicks through the sage. Hearing it in her voice anchored me. I found myself humming along before realizing I knew every note.

That night, I wrote the word in my notebook and traced it until the ink bled. I whispered it to myself as we lay under our blankets listening to coyotes call across the plain. I whispered other words that followed, ones that rose from the deep well the Army had tried to seal. Each syllable felt like water, cold and cleansing.

With language came stories I had buried. I found myself telling Chehata about a ridge where I once gathered pine nuts with my mother, about the first time my uncle took me hunting. I spoke in fragments, testing how much I could bear. She never pressed when silence overtook me. Instead, she shared her own memories, of a childhood spent watching her father trade along the river, of nights curled beside her cousins listening to legends about Coyote stealing fire. Our histories braided together without either of us naming the place the strands met.

The more I learned, the more I understood the breadth of what had been taken. Chehata's grandmother taught me the proper way to prepare a white clay wash for newborns, how to bless a cradleboard before the first journey. Her uncles let me accompany them on a hunt, pointing out tracks and scat with the patience of men determined to rebuild a hunter's instincts in someone the Army tried to turn into a soldier. Each lesson was a reclamation. Each failure reminded me this reclamation would span a lifetime.

Sometimes the past reached for me in the middle of our joy. I woke from dreams of rifle fire with my heart hammering. On those nights Chehata wrapped her arms around me and whispered, "You are here. Listen." She named the sounds of our present—the wind gripping the wickiup walls, the horses shifting in their enclosure, the slow, steady rhythm of her breath. Her voice anchored me to the ground we shared.

I began to help elders write petitions to the Indian Bureau, not because I believed the agent listened, but because the act of recording their words felt like setting stakes against erasure. When the elders struggled to articulate the insult of the new ration cuts, I offered sentences that carried their anger without letting it be twisted by the clerk. Chehata sat beside me as I wrote, nodding approval or shaking her head until the phrases matched what the community wanted to say. "This is why you learned the white men's letters," she said. "Not to please them. To defend us."

One evening, as we sat by the fire shucking corn, she placed her hand on mine. "Do you still keep your notebook by your chest?" she asked.

"Always," I said. "Old habit."

"Then fill it with us," she replied. "Write the names of the plants my grandmother shows you. Write the stories my father tells. One day you will need them."

Her certainty pierced me. I thought of the manuscript I had yet to write, of the stories of my people I still held back from myself. In that moment, I knew whatever witness I would offer the world would rest on the foundation she laid beneath me.

As summer bled into autumn, we harvested corn and stored it in woven baskets suspended from the rafters. The nights cooled enough that we slept wrapped in blankets edged with red cloth. The agency's noise receded beyond the river, a nuisance but no longer the center of our survival. Our marriage settled into the steady warmth of shared labor. When blisters cracked my palms, she spread tallow across them. When she grew weary of carrying water, I took the yoke and let her rest. We fought once over how much wood to sell to the trader—my instinct to trade matched her instinct to keep our stores full, but even in the argument, there was the certainty that neither of us would walk away.

Late in the year, after the first cold snap, we sat by the fire with Hashduba and his wife. The stars hung low, thick as seeds. I read aloud from the petition we planned to send to Washington, demanding fair distribution of beef. When I finished, Hashduba leaned back and studied me.

"You speak our grievances with conviction," he said. "I wondered if you would."

"I do because they are mine too," I answered.

He nodded slowly. "The river knows your footprints now. It will remember you walked back with your eyes open."

After they retired for the night, I remained by the embers with Chehata. She rested her head on my shoulder. "Do you regret anything?" she asked quietly.

I thought of the years I spent in uniforms, of the ghosts that still pressed against my ribs. I thought of the path that led me here, winding through grief and hunger and borrowed names. "I regret what the world forced me to do," I said. "But I do not regret where I stand now."

She breathed out, a soft sound that felt like a prayer. "Then keep standing. Keep learning. One day, you will tell our children everything you can. When that day comes, let them hear their mother's language in your mouth."

Her words settled over me like a blanket. I could not promise our children safety in a world still ruled by men who broke promises as easily as kindling, but I could promise them a father who would fight to give them the stories stolen from him. I could promise them a mother whose courage burned brighter than any campfire. I could promise them that when they asked who they were, I would answer with the names of rivers and mountains that no ledger could erase.

That night, before sleep claimed me, I whispered the words I had relearned that day. Hanyova. Kwevo. The Yavapai words for the scent of rain on dust and the echo of footsteps returning home. I whispered Chehata's name in both languages I carried now, tasting how it lived on my tongue. The river murmured beyond our doorway, patient and enduring. For the first time since the canyon, the sound felt like home.
