# Chapter 7: Taken

The knife was cold against my throat.

My uncle lay dead three feet away, his eyes still open, looking at nothing. The blood on the snow-dusted ground looked black in the firelight.

The Pima scout holding me said something I didn't understand. His hand was clamped over my mouth. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't scream. Could barely think through the terror.

There were five or six soldiers around our small fire. White men with rifles and those leather-brimmed hats. Behind them, more Native scouts—Pima, maybe Maricopa. Enemies of my people who wore pieces of Army uniforms and carried Army rifles.

They'd come out of the darkness while my uncle and I huddled by the fire. We'd been too cold, too exhausted from the hunt. The fire had been a mistake. The warmth had made us careless.

Now my uncle was dead and I was going to die too.

The tallest soldier stepped closer. He had markings on his shoulders that meant something I didn't understand. He crouched down and looked at my face. His eyes were tired. Old.

He said something in English. The Pima scout holding me responded, his knife still at my throat.

The white officer shook his head and said something sharp. An order.

The knife moved away from my throat but the scout's grip on me didn't loosen.

The officer studied me for a long moment. Then he stood and spoke to his men. Orders. Decisions being made about my life while I trembled in the scout's grip.

One of the soldiers brought rope. They tied my hands in front of me. Not tight enough to cut off blood, but firm. Permanent.

I was a prisoner now.

They sat me down away from the fire, away from my uncle's body. Two soldiers stood guard while the others gathered around the officer, looking at something—a map, maybe. Planning something.

Every few minutes one of them would glance at me. Calculating. Deciding what I was worth.

I didn't understand the words but I understood enough. They wanted something from me. Information. The cave. My people.

But I wouldn't tell them. I would be like my uncle—silent even with a knife at my throat. I would die before I betrayed my family.

The officer came over and crouched in front of me again. He said something in slow, careful English. Pointed at the darkness around us. Made a gesture like people hiding in a cave.

They already knew we were hiding somewhere. They just didn't know where.

I shook my head. Said nothing.

He sighed and stood. Spoke to the scouts. One of them—not the one who'd held the knife—came over and tried speaking in broken Yavapai.

"Where. Your. People."

I looked at my uncle's body and said nothing.

The scout grabbed my arm, squeezed hard enough to hurt. Asked again.

I stayed silent.

This went on for a long time. Questions I didn't answer. Threats I didn't understand. The cold seeping deeper into my bones. My uncle's blood freezing on the ground.

I would not tell them. Would not betray my family. Would die first.

But then one of the Pima scouts drew his knife again. Put it back against my throat. And I felt the blade—cold, sharp, real.

I was eight years old. Maybe ten. Just a child.

And I was so afraid.

The white officer said something. The scout with the knife answered. They argued—I could hear it in their tones even though I didn't know the words.

Finally the officer made a sharp gesture. The knife came away from my throat.

But the scout still held me. Still waited for an answer.

And in that moment, with my uncle dead and the knife still close and the cold and the terror filling everything, I broke.

"Cave," I whispered in Yavapai. So quiet I could barely hear myself.

The scout smiled. Said something to the officer in English.

The officer nodded. Asked a question.

The scout turned back to me. "Where. Cave."

I pointed. Toward where the canyon lay hidden in the darkness. Toward where my father and mother and sisters slept.

Toward everyone I loved.

The officer spoke to his men. Two of them immediately moved off into the darkness—runners, going to bring the main force to converge on this area.

I'd saved my life.

And doomed everyone else.

But I wasn't done. The Pima scout grabbed me by the arm, hauled me to my feet. Spoke to the officer, gesturing at me, then at the darkness where I'd pointed.

The officer nodded. Said something sharp in English.

The scout turned to me. Gestures: pointing at me, then sweeping his hand toward the darkness. You. Show. Take us.

Terror flooded through me. Pointing from a distance wasn't enough. They wanted me to lead them. To take them right to my family.

I shook my head violently. "No. No, I told you. I showed you. No more."

The scout backhanded me across the face. The world exploded in stars and pain. When my vision cleared, he had the knife out again.

One of the scouts gestured at me—hands tracing a path, then pointing at his chest, then at me. Show us. Path. Then safe. Live.

I understood through their gestures. They were going to make me betray my family twice. Once with my words. Now with my feet.

They untied my hands but the Pima scout kept hold of my arm.

I looked at my uncle's body. He'd stayed silent. Died with honor.

I'd told them where the cave was. And now I was going to lead them there.

Hours passed in a nightmare. More soldiers arrived—a few at first, then more. They gathered in the darkness, quiet and efficient. Officers issued orders through the scouts. Weapons checked. Equipment readied.

As dawn approached, a different officer arrived—more markings on his shoulders than the others. The scouts seemed to defer to him more. They spoke briefly, the new officer looking at me once.

He looked at me like I was a tool. Something to be used and discarded.

They gave me a blanket as the temperature dropped toward dawn. I wrapped it around my shoulders but couldn't stop shivering. From cold. From knowing what came next.

I thought about running. But the scout's hand never left my arm. Thought about refusing. But the knife was always there, visible threat.

I was eight years old. Just a child who wanted to live.

Even if living meant this.

As gray light touched the eastern sky, one of the scouts came over. Through gestures, he made me understand: I would show them the way. Walk. They follow. When close, I stop. Stay back. Won't be hurt.

I understood. They were offering me a fiction. A story I could tell myself. That I was forced. That I had no choice.

But I'd already chosen. When I whispered "cave" instead of staying silent.

Now I just had to live with it.

As the full light of morning came, I realized what would happen next.

They would make me take them there. Make me guide them to the cave.

Make me lead them to my family.

The scout pulled me to my feet. Gestures: Time to go. Show the way.

I looked one last time at my uncle's body. At the man who'd taught me to hunt. Who'd died with honor.

Then I turned toward where the canyon lay in the distance.

Toward my family.

Toward everyone I loved.

I was about to become their guide. Their betrayer.
