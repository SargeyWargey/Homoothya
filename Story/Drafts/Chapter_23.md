# 23  |  BECOMING WHOLE

### Late April 1922
### Fort McDowell Reservation, Arizona
The lamp burned low when I set my pencil down. Dawn had not yet touched the sill. The paper before me rippled from the sweat that had fallen from my wrist. My hand still shook. The final sentence glimmered with fresh graphite. I read it once more to be certain the words stayed on the page and did not slip back into the dark place where I had kept them hidden for half a century.

I wrote my name first. Mike Burns. I wrote it the way the government clerk in Prescott had spelled it when he recorded Captain Burns's household. Then, below it, I spelled the name Grandmother whispered when she lifted me from my mother's body. Hoomothya. The letters looked strange beside each other, yet the longer I stared, the more they settled into one belonging. Both names belonged to the same hand. Both belonged to me.

My chest ached as if I had been running. I pressed my palm against the paper to feel the impression left in the fibers. The words had weight. They were proof that the boy in the cave had not been buried with the others. Proof that I had survived. Proof that I had finally stopped hiding from myself.

The hinges in the adjoining room creaked. I turned toward the doorway as Chehata stepped into the kitchen, shawl gathered around her shoulders. She had tied her hair back, but wisps escaped around her face. She carried the smell of cedar smoke with her.

"Not at it," I answered. My voice came rough. "Finished."

Her eyes moved from my face to the stack of pages that rose beside the lamp. She did not reach for them yet. Instead, she crossed the room and set her hand on the back of my neck, thumb resting on the raised line of an old scar. The tension in my shoulders eased beneath her palm. I forgot to breathe until she reminded me by letting out a slow breath of her own.

"Let me see your hands," she said.

I turned them over. The fingers were cramped, knuckles swollen. Graphite shadowed the side of my little finger. She rubbed them gently with the tenderness she used when our babies were new and fevered. Heat spread from her touch into my forearms. My shaking eased.

"You wrote it all?" she asked.

I nodded. "Every part I had hidden."

The lamplight caught the wetness that gathered at the corner of her eye. She blinked it away and smiled. "Then you did what you promised Carlos."

I did not trust my voice, so I reached for the top page and turned it so she could see the signatures. She traced each name without touching the paper, her finger hovering a hair's breadth above the graphite.

"I knew that boy was still living in you," she whispered. "Now the whole world will know it too."

Her faith had held me upright through nights when I wanted to stop. Without it, I would have folded the book closed and buried it under the bed. Without her, I would have locked the door around Hoomothya forever. I bowed my head. "I could not have done it without you."

"You did it because you had to," she said. "And because Carlos told you the truth, you were afraid to speak. You two keep each other honest."

The kettle on the stove began to rattle as water shook inside it. Chehata moved to bank the coals and pour the first boil of the day. The smell of chicory filled the room. She set two cups on the table and spooned in evaporated milk the way she knew I liked it after sleepless nights. When she sat across from me, her eyes were still on the pages.

"Read me the last part," she said.

I picked up the final sheet. The words blurred until I wiped my eyes with the heel of my hand. I cleared my throat and began to read. My voice wavered when I reached the moment in the cave. It steadied when I reached the sentence that named me. Chehata listened without interrupting. She had heard me speak pieces of this story before. Never all of it in one breath.

When I finished she kept looking at me for a long moment. "That is the voice of the man I married," she said. "And the boy I saved when you came back to us, walking like a ghost. They finally talk to each other in those pages."

I let the sheet fall back atop the stack. "It hurt," I admitted. "Writing it hurt worse than living through it. Then it hurt again when I read it. Like the words were cutting their way out of bone."

"Hurting means it is true," she said. She lifted her cup. "Drink. Your voice needs to be steady when you bring it to Carlos."

I took a swallow. The bitter drink warmed my throat, and the warmth spread through my chest. Outside, the first sparrows began their chatter in the mesquite tree by the gate. Pale light crept along the floorboards. The house stayed hushed around us. A clock ticked steady in the front room. Her knitting basket sat undisturbed beside the stove.

"We should eat before you go," Chehata said. She rose and moved easily into the rhythm of our morning, even though sleep still weighed in her eyes. I stood to help, but she shook her head. "No. Your task today is to protect what you wrote. Wrap it. Walk it to your cousin before the heat sets in."

"He will still be asleep," I said.

"Carlos has waited a long time. He will wake early today."

I placed the manuscript on a square of muslin and folded the cloth over it, tucking the edges so the bundle would not shift. Chehata watched to make sure I tied the knot firmly. "The wind is strong today," she said. "Do not let dust into those pages."

She packed a small packet of tortillas and dried apples and slipped it into my hand as she had done when I left for ditch work in younger years. The benches along the wall held only the hats of visiting grandchildren. I paused beside the doorway to look at the photographs arranged there: Solomon with his railroad crew, Carlos in his uniform, Katie with her girls gathered beside her. Each face carried some piece of the history I had just written. The manuscript in my hands would tell them where those pieces came from. That knowledge steadied me more than the coffee had.

"I will be back by supper," I promised.

"Take your time," Chehata replied. "Carlos will keep you talking."

The sun was a thin red line when I stepped outside. Dawn chill rolled in from the Verde River. The cottonwoods along the agency ditch rustled. A wagon rattled in the distance. I tucked the bundle beneath my arm and set out toward the road that ran past the schoolhouse and agency store.

I followed the same path I had walked in February when Carlos first called me to tell the harder truth. The agency yard was quiet except for a few elders tending the morning fire near the roundhouse. Telephone poles marched along the packed earth lane, their wires humming faintly above the adobe walls. I passed the church and the corrals where two boys checked the hooves of a mule before leading it toward the fields. Farther on, I skirted the parade ground, now dotted with family gardens. The smell of breakfast bread drifted from the cookhouse.

No one looked twice at the older Yavapai man carrying a cloth-wrapped bundle tied with butcher's string. That anonymity felt like a blessing after so many years moving under the eyes of soldiers and agents.

Carlos's house stood near the bend where the agency road met the trail toward the Verde. The same two-room adobe awaited me, shutters propped to welcome the morning breeze. A sliver of lamplight shone through the front window just as it had the night I first brought him my other manuscript.

I stood on the porch and breathed once to steady myself. My pulse beat hard in my throat. I knocked softly. From inside, Carlos called for me to enter. He stood in the doorway a moment later, a blanket draped over his shoulders, but his posture still straight. His gaze dropped to the bundle in my arms and warmed with understanding. He stepped aside without a word and motioned me toward the room he favored for receiving visitors.

"Leave it on my desk," he said. "I will read while the morning is still cool."

I set the manuscript gently on the polished wood. The desk bore the marks of years of use. Ink stains near the inkwell. Two worn places where his elbows rested while he wrote editorials for Wassaja. A stack of pamphlets waited to be mailed to reservations across the country. I placed my bundle between the pamphlets and the brass lamp.

"I will come back in the afternoon," I said.

"I will be ready," he answered.

Outside, the yard had warmed. I looked back once through the open window. Sunlight caught the white cloth around the pages. I felt exposed leaving them there, as if part of me remained on the desk. I walked away quickly before I changed my mind and scooped them back into my arms.

I had several hours to fill before returning. I walked toward the Verde River to keep myself from pacing outside Carlos's door. The smell of damp earth rose from the fields irrigated by canals I had helped dig. Farmers already bent over seedlings, their hats rising and falling like birds. In the distance, the Mazatzal ridges sat purple against the lightening sky. I stood at the edge of the riverbank and listened to the slow current slide past cottonwoods. The sound reminded me of Beaver Creek before the army came.

I could not stay still. Memories stirred and pushed me along the water's edge. Each step carried me deeper into recollection. I thought of the day in 1872 when Carlos and I were separated. I thought of the scout who dragged me away from the cave. I thought of the nights in Prescott when I stared at the ceiling and wondered if anyone from our camp still breathed. With the manuscript now in Carlos's house, those questions had a new shape. We had lived. We had two names. We had two paths that brought us back to one point.

Around noon, the sun blazed high. I sought shade beneath a cottonwood and ate the tortillas and dried apples Chehata had packed for me. She thought of everything. When the mission bell near the school rang three times, I brushed crumbs from my coat and started back toward Carlos's lane.

The front door stood ajar when I arrived, propped with a chair to invite the breeze through the hallway. Carlos called from inside for me to come in. His voice sounded thick.

He stood behind his desk when I entered. The cloth lay open, the pages spread across the surface in a careful stack, the corners weighted with paperweights so the afternoon breeze would not disturb them. He had pushed his spectacles up onto his forehead. His eyes were red and swollen. He did not bother to hide the tears.

For a moment, we only looked at each other. Then he shook his head slowly. "Brother," he said, voice hoarse. "You did not tell me you would cut open the world."

I swallowed hard. "I tried to be honest."

"You succeeded," he said. He pressed his hand to the stack of pages. "I reached the cave just now. I had to stop because I could not see the lines through the water in my eyes."

He pulled out the chair beside the desk and motioned for me to sit. When I did, he placed the top pages in front of me, his finger tapping the paragraph where I described the soldiers levering boulders over the rim. "When I read this, I heard what you heard from that ridge," he said. "I heard the stone grind and shatter. I had tried to believe you dreamed it. Your words proved it was real. I am grateful and I am grieving."

We sat together in the close parlor while the house settled around us. A breeze pressed the curtain against the frame. Somewhere in the kitchen, a kettle clicked as it cooled. Inside the room, time slowed.

We spoke the names of our family aloud, taking turns like a prayer. Mother. Father. Grandmother. Nashta. Baby Yava. We described the way each voice sounded, the way they laughed, and the foods they cooked. We had avoided speaking their names together for fifty years. Saying them now filled the room with presence. I felt their attention like a breeze on the back of my neck.

"I carried their names like stones in my pockets," I admitted. "Heavy. Always there. I was afraid that if I took them out to look at them, they would crumble. Writing them kept them whole."

"You carried them for both of us," Carlos said. "While I ran across the country fighting for rights in Washington, you stayed close to the land and the old ones. You kept our language alive. You married Chehata. You raised children who know who they are."

"And you fought in those cities so they could one day read what I wrote," I replied. "Your speeches opened doors, my words will walk through. We both did what we could."

We fell silent. Afternoon light striped the floor through the shutters. The smell of sage medicine drifted from a room down the hall. Carlos leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. "We should go home," he said after a moment.

"We are home," I said, confused.

He shook his head. "Not this home. The first one. The cliffs, the river, the cave. We have written the story on paper. Now we need to stand in the place where it happened and speak it aloud with the wind listening."

The idea had hovered in the corners of my mind ever since I began the manuscript. Hearing him say it gave it shape. My stomach tightened. Part of me wanted to refuse. The land carried ghosts. Another part leaned toward the thought like a plant toward sunlight.

"Do you think you can manage the ride?" I asked. His cough had worsened in recent months. Tuberculosis had settled in his lungs despite the tonics he brewed. A journey to the Salt River would not be simple.

"We will need supplies," I said, trying to think through the practical steps so the fear would not take hold. "Horses. Tents. Dried food. Permits from the reservation agent so they do not think we are stirring up trouble."

"I will write the agent," Carlos said. "He will listen. He owes me for the time I treated his son without pay."

I will speak with Chehata tonight. If she agrees, we can leave once the heat breaks this winter."

Carlos's smile widened. "She will see the necessity before either of us. She always has."

We sat with the plan between us like a small fire. Each detail we named fed it more fuel. By the time Carlos cleared his throat to remind himself to take his tonic, we had sketched a rough route: depart Fort McDowell with dawn, follow the Apache Trail to rest his lungs, then cross into the canyon lands where our people had sheltered. Just the two of us would travel; no one else needed to bear the weight of what we meant to do. We would stand at the rim above the Cave and speak the names of our dead into the afternoon wind. We would carry tobacco and cloth to tie in the branches above the river. We would bring the bones of our people back so they could rest in the soil that still knew their names. We would place our hands on the rock to feel the resonance of fifty years of silence and break it.

When Carlos rose, his knees cracked. Age had crept into our joints, yet purpose straightened his back. He clasped my shoulders. "Do not doubt the power of what you wrote," he said. "It will carry us as surely as any horse."

I gathered the manuscript back into the cloth so the pages would remain clean. Carlos hesitated, then placed his hand atop mine on the bundle. "Leave it here tonight," he requested. "I want to read it once more before sleep and again when dawn comes."

"Keep them," I said.

"I will guard them as carefully as I ever guarded my patients," he promised.

We embraced. It was not a quick clasp of hands but a full hold that drew me against his chest. I felt his ribs through his thin frame. His breath rattled slightly. I pressed my cheek to his shoulder. We had not held each other like this since we were boys huddled for warmth on that march north. "We survived," I whispered.

"We survived," he echoed. "Now let us make sure the world understands what that survival cost."

Evening shadows stretched long across the agency road as I walked home. The heat of the day lifted. Dust hung in the air, turned golden by the lowering sun. Children tossed pebbles into a circle drawn in the dirt. Someone sang in Yavapai near a cook fire. The sounds of the community wrapped around me like a blanket.

When I reached our gate, Chehata stood waiting with her hands on her hips, flour dusting her apron. She read the answer on my face before I spoke. "He read it," she said.

"He read it. He wept. We made plans," I said, still stunned by the way the afternoon had unfolded.

She drew me inside. The house smelled of stew and fresh bread cooling for the sons and daughters who visited on Sundays. Tonight, the table held only two bowls. We ate quietly, the scrape of our spoons the loudest sound, and I told her what I could while the plan for the pilgrimage sat between us like a glowing coal.

After supper, the house settled into the quiet that still startled me. Chehata and I returned to the kitchen table. She listened as I described every detail of the day. When I told her of the journey Carlos wanted, she closed her eyes and nodded slowly.

"You have carried this return in your bones for years," she said. "Go. Stand on that rim. Speak their names so the land hears the truth from your own mouth. I will keep the household steady while you are gone. I will pray for the land to be gentle."

"I am afraid," I admitted.

"Courage is not the absence of fear," she said. "It is walking toward it with the truth in your hands. You already did the hardest part when you wrote those pages."

Night settled softly around the house. A thin sliver of moon rose over the cottonwoods. I lay in bed beside her and listened to her breathing while the images of the day replayed in my mind: the signatures on white paper, her hand on my neck, the sound of Carlos's voice thick with tears, the resolve in his words when he spoke of returning to the land. I felt the boy I had been sit up within me, no longer locked away. He looked around my life with curious eyes. He recognized the woman who kept us alive. He recognized the cousin who had become a brother. He recognized the road leading back to the red cliffs. For the first time, he did not flinch.

Before sleep took me, I whispered the names of the dead into the darkness. Each name left my mouth like a glowing coal. Each coal floated above us and filled the room with soft light. By the time I closed my eyes, the light had woven itself into a net sturdy enough to carry us eastward when winter came.

The world beyond our door still turned with indifference. Trains would haul soldiers and supplies. Politicians would sign papers that said we were citizens now. Newspapers would debate whether Native words belonged in print. Yet inside our small house at Fort McDowell, truth settled into ink and cloth. It breathed through the lungs of survivors. It rested in the hands of a woman who believed in both of us. It pointed unerringly toward a canyon where we would speak it aloud. I held that knowledge close and let it lull me to sleep.
