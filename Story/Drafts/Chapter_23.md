# 23  |  FINISHED

### Late April 1922
### Fort McDowell Reservation, Arizona
The lamp burned low when I set my pencil down. Dawn had not yet touched the sill. The paper before me rippled from the sweat that had fallen from my wrist. My hand still shook. The final sentence glimmered with fresh graphite. I read it once more to be certain the words stayed on the page and did not slip back into the dark place where I had kept them hidden for half a century.

I wrote my name first. Mike Burns. I wrote it the way the government clerk in Prescott had spelled it when he recorded Captain Burns's household. Then, below it, I spelled the name Grandmother whispered when she lifted me from my mother's body. Hoomothya. The letters looked strange beside each other, yet the longer I stared, the more they settled into one belonging. Both names belonged to the same hand. Both belonged to me.

My chest ached as if I had been running. I pressed my palm against the paper to feel the impression left in the fibers. The words had weight. They were proof that the boy in the cave had not been buried with the others. Proof that I had survived. Proof that I had finally stopped hiding from myself.

The hinges in the adjoining room creaked. I turned toward the doorway as Chehata stepped into the kitchen, shawl gathered around her shoulders. She had tied her hair back, but wisps escaped around her face. She carried the smell of cedar smoke with her.

"Not at it," I answered. My voice came rough. "Finished."

Her eyes moved from my face to the stack of pages that rose beside the lamp. She did not reach for them yet. Instead, she crossed the room and set her hand on the back of my neck, thumb resting on the raised line of an old scar. The tension in my shoulders eased beneath her palm. I forgot to breathe until she reminded me by letting out a slow breath of her own.

"Let me see your hands," she said.

I turned them over. The fingers were cramped, knuckles swollen. Graphite shadowed the side of my little finger. She rubbed them gently with the tenderness she used when our babies were new and fevered. Heat spread from her touch into my forearms. My shaking eased.

"You wrote it all?" she asked.

I nodded. "Every part I had hidden."

The lamplight caught the wetness that gathered at the corner of her eye. She blinked it away and smiled. "Then you did what you promised Carlos."

I did not trust my voice, so I reached for the top page and turned it so she could see the signatures. She traced each name without touching the paper, her finger hovering a hair's breadth above the graphite.

"I knew that boy was still living in you," she whispered. "Now the whole world will know it too."

Her faith had held me upright through nights when I wanted to stop. Without it, I would have folded the book closed and buried it under the bed. Without her, I would have locked the door around Hoomothya forever. I bowed my head. "I could not have done it without you."

"You did it because you had to," she said. "And because Carlos told you the truth, you were afraid to speak. You two keep each other honest."

The kettle on the stove began to rattle as water shook inside it. Chehata moved to bank the coals and pour the first boil of the day. The smell of chicory filled the room. She set two cups on the table and spooned in evaporated milk the way she knew I liked it after sleepless nights. When she sat across from me, her eyes were still on the pages.

"Read me the last part," she said.

I picked up the final sheet. The words blurred until I wiped my eyes with the heel of my hand. I cleared my throat and began to read. My voice wavered when I reached the moment in the cave. It steadied when I reached the sentence that named me. Chehata listened without interrupting. She had heard me speak pieces of this story before. Never all of it in one breath.

When I finished she kept looking at me for a long moment. "That is the voice of the man I married," she said. "And the boy I saved when you came back to us, walking like a ghost. They finally talk to each other in those pages."

I let the sheet fall back atop the stack. "It hurt," I admitted. "Writing it hurt worse than living through it. Then it hurt again when I read it. Like the words were cutting their way out of bone."

"Hurting means it is true," she said. She lifted her cup. "Drink. Your voice needs to be steady when you bring it to Carlos."

I took a swallow. The bitter drink warmed my throat, and the warmth spread through my chest. Outside, the first sparrows began their chatter in the mesquite tree by the gate. Pale light crept along the floorboards. The house stayed hushed around us. A clock ticked steady in the front room. Her knitting basket sat undisturbed beside the stove.

"We should eat before you go," Chehata said. She rose and moved easily into the rhythm of our morning, even though sleep still weighed in her eyes. I stood to help, but she shook her head. "No. Your task today is to protect what you wrote. Wrap it. Walk it to your cousin before the heat sets in."

"He will still be asleep," I said.

"Carlos has waited a long time. He will wake early today."

I placed the manuscript on a square of muslin and folded the cloth over it, tucking the edges so the bundle would not shift. Chehata watched to make sure I tied the knot firmly. "The wind is strong today," she said. "Do not let dust into those pages."

She packed a small packet of tortillas and dried apples and slipped it into my hand as she had done when I left for ditch work in younger years. The benches along the wall held only the hats of visiting grandchildren. I paused beside the doorway to look at the photographs arranged there: Solomon with his railroad crew, Carlos in his uniform, Katie with her girls gathered beside her. Each face carried some piece of the history I had just written. The manuscript in my hands would tell them where those pieces came from. That knowledge steadied me more than the coffee had.

"I will be back by supper," I promised.

"Take your time," Chehata replied. "Carlos will keep you talking."

The sun was a thin red line when I stepped outside. Dawn chill rolled in from the Verde River. The cottonwoods along the agency ditch rustled. A wagon rattled in the distance. I tucked the bundle beneath my arm and set out toward the road that ran past the schoolhouse and agency store.

I followed the same path I had walked in February when Carlos first called me to tell the harder truth. The agency yard was quiet except for a few elders tending the morning fire near the roundhouse. Telephone poles marched along the packed earth lane, their wires humming faintly above the adobe walls. I passed the church and the corrals where two boys checked the hooves of a mule before leading it toward the fields. Farther on, I skirted the parade ground, now dotted with family gardens. The smell of breakfast bread drifted from the cookhouse.

No one looked twice at the older Yavapai man carrying a cloth-wrapped bundle tied with butcher's string. That anonymity felt like a blessing after so many years moving under the eyes of soldiers and agents.

Carlos's house stood near the bend where the agency road met the trail toward the Verde. The same two-room adobe awaited me, shutters propped to welcome the morning breeze. A sliver of lamplight shone through the front window just as it had the night I first brought him my other manuscript.

I stood on the porch and breathed once to steady myself. My pulse beat hard in my throat. I knocked softly. From inside, Carlos called for me to enter. He stood in the doorway a moment later, a blanket draped over his shoulders, but his posture still straight. His gaze dropped to the bundle in my arms and warmed with understanding. He stepped aside without a word and motioned me toward the room he favored for receiving visitors.

"Leave it on my desk," he said. "I will read while the morning is still cool."

I set the manuscript gently on the polished wood. The desk bore the marks of years of use. Ink stains near the inkwell. Two worn places where his elbows rested while he wrote editorials for Wassaja. A stack of pamphlets waited to be mailed to reservations across the country. I placed my bundle between the pamphlets and the brass lamp.

"I will come back in the afternoon," I said.

"I will be ready," he answered.
