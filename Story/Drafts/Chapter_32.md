# THE SKELETON CAVE REMAINS 

### 1923-1985
The bones Carlos and Mike retrieved were not the last to be recovered from Skeleton Cave.

In 1925, Mike made another journey to the cave, this time accompanied by a Maricopa County sheriff and several other Yavapai individuals. They collected more remains, continuing the work of bringing their ancestors home.

The main reinterment took place in 1933. The skeletal remains recovered from multiple trips to Skeleton Cave were laid to rest in a mass grave in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell. One grave for the approximately 80 people killed on a winter morning sixty years earlier.

The grave had no marker for decades. The dead rested in their own land, finally, but in silence.

On Memorial Day 1985, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation held a service and dedicated a tombstone over the mass grave. Norman Austin, then tribal president, spoke clearly: "The record has never been set straight. The victims were Yavapais, not Apaches."

Even in death, even after a century, the fight for accurate witness continued.
