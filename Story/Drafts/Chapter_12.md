# 12  |  THE PAST

### February 1922
### Fort McDowell, Arizona
Carlos Montezuma looked older than I had expected. We were nearly the same age—he was fifty-seven, I was fifty-six—but the years had carved deeper into him. His face was lined and his hair had gone completely gray, but his eyes were alert, missing nothing. He stood when I approached his door, moving with the careful precision of a man learning to accommodate pain.

"Cousin." He embraced me, and I felt how thin he had become. "Come in. Sit. I've been hoping you would visit."

His house was simple but orderly. Books lined one wall, a desk sat near the window where morning light could reach it, and a leather bag that I recognized as his medical kit rested in the corner. The room smelled of coffee and something medicinal.

"You look well," I said, which was not quite true but seemed like the right thing to say.

He laughed. "You were never a good liar, Mike. I'm dying. We both know it." He poured coffee from a pot on the stove and handed me a cup. "But I'm home. That's what matters."

I sat at his table and cupped the coffee between my hands. "Chehata asked me to bring you food tomorrow. She says you're not eating enough."

"Chehata is probably right." He eased into the chair across from me and studied my face. "But you didn't walk here to discuss my appetite. What's on your mind?"

I had rehearsed this conversation during the walk, but now the words felt clumsy. I set my coffee down and drew the portfolio from under my arm.

"I wrote something. About the Yavapai. About what happened at Rio Verde and the March. About the promises that were broken." I placed the portfolio on the table between us. "I've been trying to get it published for twelve years. No one wants it."

Carlos pulled the portfolio toward him and opened it. His fingers traced the first page, reading the opening lines. Then he looked up at me.

"You wrote this?"

"Yes."

"All of it?"

"Three hundred pages. My testimony and the testimony of elders who survived. Everything I witnessed from my position with the Army. Everything they told me about what I couldn't see."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then he closed the portfolio without reading further.

"I need to read this properly. Not skim it. Really read it." He met my eyes. "Can you leave it with me for a few days?"

"Of course."

"And Mike?" He placed his hand on the portfolio. "Thank you for writing this. Whatever happens with publication, thank you for doing the work of witness."



Four days passed. I worked the irrigation ditches and helped repair a neighbor's fence and tried not to think about Carlos reading my manuscript. But Chehata saw through me.

"You're worried," she said on the third night.

"I'm not worried."

"You've checked the path to his house six times today."

I had no answer for that.

On the fifth day, a boy arrived at our door with a message: Carlos wanted to see me. I walked to his house in the late afternoon, my heart beating harder than the distance warranted.

He was sitting at his desk when I arrived, the manuscript open in front of him. Pages were marked with strips of paper. His coffee cup sat untouched and cold.

"Sit," he said without preamble.

I sat.

Carlos leaned back in his chair and regarded me with an expression I couldn't read. Finally, he spoke.

"This is powerful testimony, cousin. You've documented what they did to our people. The broken promises. The forced march. The suffering." He paused. "But something is missing."

My chest tightened. "What do you mean?"

"You're writing around something." He tapped the manuscript. "There's a darkness you won't touch. A pain you won't name."

"I wrote about the March. About Rio Verde. About—"

"You wrote about what you witnessed from your position with the Army." His voice was gentle but firm. "You wrote about the suffering of others. But you didn't write about what happened to you. About your childhood before Captain Burns. About the boy you were."

The room felt suddenly airless. I looked away, unable to meet his eyes.

"I wrote what matters. The witness testimony. What was done to the Yavapai people."

"And that's important. Essential." Carlos leaned forward. "But you're telling the story of our people's suffering while hiding your own. You're documenting atrocities without telling yours."

"I don't need to—"

"About before?" He wouldn't let me finish. "About your family? About your past?"

The words hit like a fist. I stood up, the chair scraping loud against the floor.

"I should go."

"Mike." Carlos's voice stopped me at the door. "I'm not saying this to hurt you. I'm saying it because I see the hole at its center. You're trying to be the invisible witness, but you can't be invisible. You were there. You were a child. That's part of the story."

"It's my story. I can tell it however I want."

"You can." He stood slowly. "But if you want people to feel the truth instead of just reading facts, then you need to let them see the real cost. What it did to one boy."

I gripped the door frame. "I can't."

"Can't or won't?"

"Both." The word came out harsh. "Some things..." I couldn't finish.

Carlos crossed the room until he stood beside me. He placed his hand on my shoulder.

"I know," he said quietly. "I know what it means to go back there in your mind." His grip tightened. "But you're the only one who can tell it. The only one living. And if you don't write it, that boy's story dies with you."

"What boy?"

"Hoomothya."

The name hung in the air between us. I hadn't heard it spoken aloud in decades. Chehata knew it, but we never used it. It belonged to a child who had died, and I had spent fifty years trying to forget he ever existed.

"I can't," I whispered.

"You can." Carlos guided me back to the chair and sat beside me. "Listen to me, cousin. Your children, they need to know where they come from. Not just 'Mike Burns the Army scout.' The family you lost. The child you were."

"They don't need that darkness."

"They need the whole truth." He picked up the manuscript. "This is good work. Important. But it's incomplete. You're telling them what happened to the Yavapai people without telling them what happened to their own father. To the boy who became their father."

I stared at the marked pages. "Even if I could write it, no publisher would want it. You read the rejection letters I showed you."

"Maybe. Maybe not." Carlos set the manuscript down. "But that's not the only reason to write it. Think about this: a hundred years from now, what will remain? Paper records. Your words written down. If you don't tell the whole story, your grandchildren's grandchildren will never know. They'll have this—" he tapped the manuscript "—which is valuable. But they won't have the rest. The before. The boy. The loss."

"I don't know if I can go back there."

"Then don't go back as you are now. Write it as him. Let that boy tell his own story."

"He's dead."

"Is he?" Carlos looked at me steadily. "Or did you just bury him because it was the only way to survive?"

I couldn't answer. The truth was too raw.

Carlos returned to his chair. "When the publishers read this manuscript, they see another Indian complaining about broken promises. It doesn't move them because it doesn't make them feel."

"I wrote about suffering—"

"You wrote about it from outside." He leaned forward. "You wrote: 'I witnessed the people marching.' That's true. But it's also safe. It keeps you apart from the pain." He paused. "But if you wrote from inside it, if you let them see what that child saw, what he felt, that's the kind of truth that changes people."

The words pierced something I had kept sealed. I felt tears burning behind my eyes and fought them back.

"That's not witness testimony."

"That's truth," Carlos said quietly. "The kind that makes people feel what happened."

I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand. "I don't know if I have the strength."

"You have it. You've survived this long. You've carried that boy inside you for fifty years without letting him speak." Carlos's voice was gentle now. "Let him speak, cousin. Let him tell what happened. Not for the publishers. Not even for your children, though they need it. Let him speak because he deserves to be remembered."

We sat in silence. Outside, the afternoon light was fading. Somewhere children were playing, their voices carrying through the desert air.

"I wouldn't know how to start," I finally said.

"Start at the beginning. Before the soldiers came. When we were just boys learning to hunt and gather mesquite." Carlos picked up the manuscript and held it out to me. "Write about those boys. Let readers know us before you show them what happened. Make them care."

I took the manuscript, feeling its weight differently now. It was no longer complete. It was missing the heart.

"And if I write it and still can't get it published?"

"Then at least it exists." Carlos smiled, tired but certain. "Then at least your children can read it. At least you've honored him by remembering him on paper instead of just carrying him as silent pain."

He stood slowly, and I rose with him.

"Think about it," he said. "You don't have to decide now. But think about it. For him. Because he deserves to be more than the ghost you've been trying to forget."

He rested his hand on the table between us for a long, quiet moment, then nodded for me to go.



I walked home as the sun set, the manuscript under my arm and Carlos's words echoing in my mind. Chehata was cooking when I arrived. She looked up and saw my face.

"What did he say?"

I set the manuscript on the table. "He said it's not complete. That I need to write about before. About the boy I was."

She came and stood beside me. "Can you?"

"I don't know."

"He knows about getting stories heard. About what people need to read."

"He said I should write it for the children. So they know where they come from. The whole truth." I looked at her. "Do they need to know that darkness?"

"They need to know you." Her voice was firm. "Not just Mike Burns who votes and writes letters. But the child you were. The family you lost. Yes, it's dark. But it's their history too."

I sank into the chair. "It's been fifty years. I've spent fifty years building walls around those memories. If I tear them down..."

"Then maybe you'll finally be whole." She knelt beside the chair and took my hands. "You've carried that boy like a wound that never healed. Maybe writing his story is how you honor it."

"What if I can't?"

"Then you can't. But you won't know until you try." She squeezed my hands. "And I'll be here. You're not alone in this."

I looked at the manuscript on the table. Three hundred pages of careful witness testimony. Important work. But incomplete.

"I need to think," I said.

"Then think." Chehata kissed my forehead and returned to the stove. "But don't think too long. Carlos won't be here forever. And neither will you."



That night I lay awake listening to Chehata breathe beside me. I thought about the boy I had been, the child who had climbed mesquite trees and learned to track deer and listened to his grandmother's stories. I thought about how completely I had buried him, how thoroughly I had tried to forget he existed.

And I thought about Carlos's question: "Is he dead? Or did you just bury him because it was the only way to survive?"

The truth was, I didn't know anymore. I had spent so many years being Mike Burns—the student, the scout, the citizen, the witness—that I had almost convinced myself that boy was someone else. Someone who had died while I survived by becoming somebody new.

But Carlos had seen through it. He had read my manuscript and seen the missing piece. The boy at the center who I had tried to write out of the story even as I documented everything that happened around him.

"Let him speak," Carlos had said.

I turned the words over in my mind. Could I? Could I go back to that childhood and write it down? Could I let myself remember the mother, the grandmother, the uncle, the father? Could I write about mesquite harvests and hunting lessons and the happiness of a child who didn't know yet that everything would be destroyed?

Could I write about what happened?

The question stopped me. Everything else—the childhood, the family, the lessons—that I might be able to write. But the rest... that was the darkness Carlos had named. The thing I had spent fifty years refusing to touch.

"You're the only one living who can tell it," he had said.

And he was right. Everyone else who had been there was dead. The soldiers had told their version—victory, decisive action, successful campaign. But no one had told it from the other side. No one had written what it was like to be that child.

No one but me.

I rose quietly and went to the table. The manuscript lay where I had left it. I opened it and found a blank page at the back. In the dim moonlight I picked up my pencil and wrote the title.

Then I set the pencil down and stared at what I had written. Just a name I hadn't spoken in fifty years. But it felt like opening a door that had been sealed shut.

I heard Chehata rise and felt her presence behind me.

"You're going to write it."

"I think I have to." I touched the words on the page. "Carlos is right. If I don't, that boy's story dies with me. And he deserves better than that."

She placed her hand on my shoulder.

"It's going to be hard."

"Yes." She squeezed my shoulder. "But you're strong enough. You survived it once. You can survive remembering it."

I wasn't sure she was right. But I had to try. Because Carlos had given me something I didn't know I needed: permission to remember. Permission to grieve.

I would write his story. Not as Mike Burns looking back. But as him, that child who had loved and lost and witnessed and somehow survived to become me.



The next morning I returned to Carlos's house. He was sitting in the sun outside his door, wrapped in a blanket despite the warming day.

"Cousin." He smiled when he saw me. "That was fast."

"I'm going to write it," I said. "I don't know if I can finish it. I don't know if it will be any good. But I'm going to try."

Carlos's smile widened. "Good. That's good." He gestured to the chair beside him. "Sit."

I sat. "I'm going to start at the beginning. Before the soldiers came. I'm going to write about the boy I was, the family I had, the life I lived. Let readers know him before I show them what came after."

"Yes." Carlos nodded. "Make them care about him first."

"And then..." I swallowed hard. "Then I'll write about the rest. About what I witnessed."

"It will be the hardest thing you've ever written."

"I know."

"But it will also be the truest." He reached over and gripped my arm. "And Mike? When you write it, write it as him. Don't hide. Make readers live it with that boy."

"I'll try."

"You'll do more than try." He released my arm. "You'll succeed. Because he's depending on you after fifty years of silence."

We sat together in the morning sun, two old men who had survived what should have killed us. Carlos had chosen to fight publicly. I had chosen to fight quietly, to document and witness and preserve.

Different paths. Same mission.

"Thank you," I said. "For seeing what was missing. For pushing me to write what I was afraid to write."

"That's what family does." He smiled. "We see each other's blind spots." He paused. "And Mike? When you finish this, I want to read it. Before I..." He didn't finish.

"You'll read it," I promised. "Every word."

I walked home to begin the hardest work I had ever attempted: remembering the child I had spent a lifetime trying to forget, and letting him finally speak.

I would tell the story of a boy, of a Yavapai, of Hoomothya.
