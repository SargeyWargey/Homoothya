# THE ONGOING STRUGGLE

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation continues on the reservation established in 1903. The current size is approximately 24,000 acres with around 950 community members.

Before European contact, Yavapai land stretched across millions of acres of central Arizona: the Verde Valley, the Mogollon Rim, the Salt River Canyon, the Superstition Mountains, and the Bradshaw Mountains. Seasonal camps, hunting grounds, gathering sites, and sacred places spanning a geography larger than some eastern states.

Now: 24,000 acres.

The Verde River and Salt River water sources remain contested. The Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1990 secured water rights that should never have been in question. But urban development, agricultural interests, and mining operations continue to threaten access, requiring constant vigilance more than a century after Mike and Carlos fought to preserve Fort McDowell.

Ancestral Yavapai lands remain in federal, state, or private hands. Sacred sites, including Skeleton Cave itself, are not under Yavapai control. The people must ask permission to visit places that were theirs for thousands of years.

The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation maintains cultural programs to reclaim what boarding schools like Carlisle attempted to erase. Language revitalization teaches young people the Yavapai language that Mike lost as a child and spent his adult life relearning. A tribal museum preserves Yavapai history. A youth drum group keeps traditional songs alive. Cultural practitioners teach basket weaving, food preparation, and seasonal ceremonies.

Every ceremony, every word spoken in Yavapai, every child taught traditional ways is an act of resistance against the cultural genocide that Carlisle and the reservation system were designed to accomplish.

Contemporary Yavapai people continue to document ongoing challenges: environmental destruction from mining and development, bureaucratic neglect and broken promises, threats to sovereignty, the slow violence of poverty, and inadequate healthcare. New generations of advocates, writers, and activists carry forward the work Mike began. They refuse to let their history be erased.
