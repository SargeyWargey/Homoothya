# 26  |  THE BURIAL

### February 1923
### Fort McDowell Reservation
By the time the first light colored the eastern ridge, hoofbeats already echoed along the agency road. Chehata and I had sat through the night beside Carlos, the lamp turned low so shadows could rest against the adobe walls. When the knock came at the door, it carried the urgency of a drum. I opened it to find Solomon wrapped in a gray blanket, breath steaming in the cold. He had ridden from the irrigated fields before dawn to take the news to every ranch and work camp.

"I told the Verde ranch hands," he said, voice raw. "The irrigation crew will ride in with their families. I sent a boy toward the rail spur, too." He paused, hand pressed to his chest. "Everyone is coming."

Chehata set a pot of cedar on the stove and coaxed smoke through the rooms. The scent settled into the boards and cloth as if it meant to hold us upright. She wrapped Carlos in a clean shirt and laid his physician's coat across his chest. I smoothed the fabric over his hands until it lay straight, a second skin of work he had never set aside.

Within the hour, riders cut down from the Mesa, dust rising behind them. A wagon from the mining camp rattled past the cottonwoods with two women seated in the bed, their shawls pulled tight. Children ran ahead of their mothers, faces solemn, eyes wide. I stood on the porch and watched the yard fill with the people he had healed through years of travel. Names and faces stirred like a river returning to its banks.

Neighbors from Fort McDowell came first. Then a physician from Phoenix arrived with a satchel of instruments slung over his shoulder. "Dr. Montezuma set my broken arm in a railcar with nothing but a bottle of whiskey and iron nerves," he told me, gripping my forearm. "I would not have the use of this hand without him."

Another wagon carried an older couple from Prescott. The man leaned on a cane and introduced himself as Mr. Wilcox, owner of a creosote mill. "He saved my youngest boy during the influenza," he said. "When every other doctor closed their doors to Indians, he worked through the night in our kitchen." He removed his hat and stepped into the house, tears bright in his eyes.

By midmorning, the room around Carlos thrummed with a soft murmur of voices. Chehata directed the women with a quiet authority born of decades tending the living and the dead. My daughters spread quilts on the floor for the grandchildren. My sons carried in benches from the schoolhouse so the elders would not have to stand through the vigil. The physician's bag sat on the table, its weight a reminder of the promise I had made only days before.

Visitors from Chicago arrived with the noon train. They came straight from the depot in a hired motorcar that rattled like loose tools. The driver handed me a telegram, the paper creased from the ride. It was from a pastor who had worked with Carlos among urban Indian families. He wrote that they were holding a prayer vigil in a church basement that night, candles lit for the doctor who never refused a call. The couple who stepped out of the car shared stories of free clinics and speeches on self-determination delivered between surgeries. Their voices carried the clipped cadence of the city, yet their grief sounded the same as ours.

We opened the house for the mourning watch at sunset. The windows glowed amber. Candles lined the sill above Carlos's body. People gathered in a broad circle, leaving a clear path for those still arriving. Chehata began to chant an old traveling song. Her voice wrapped around the room, steady and low, reminding us that a journey awaited even in death.

One by one, those he had healed came forward to speak. A young mother cradling an infant stepped near his feet. "Dr. Montezuma delivered this child when the company doctor refused," she said. "He told me to sing our songs while he worked so the baby would recognize them when she cried." Her words broke and rose again. The circle murmured agreement.

A railroad worker with a scar along his jaw told of a winter storm near Ash Fork when a derailment injured half a crew. "We set torches around a boxcar to make an operating room," he said. "He stitched torn flesh while the snow drove sideways. We would have frozen without him." He placed a calloused hand on the edge of the blanket and bowed his head.

An elderly Yavapai woman stood with her hands clasped at her waist. "He wrote letters for me when the agency refused to send medicine," she said. "He wrote in English so strong they could not ignore it." She met my eyes and nodded once, as if passing the duty to me through air thick with cedar smoke.

As the evening deepened, the stories wove themselves into a braid of gratitude and sorrow. I listened, feeling each account settle against the years I had shared with my cousin. When there was a pause, Chehata touched my arm. "It is your turn," she whispered.

I stepped into the space beside Carlos. The room quieted. The only sound was the soft crackle from the hearth. I looked at the faces before me: our children, our grandchildren, neighbors who had known us since boyhood, strangers who had crossed deserts to stand in this room. I placed my palm on the physician's coat.

"He was born in a cave with bullets in the air," I said. "He learned the White men's tongue while hiding his own name in his mouth. We traveled across this territory as boys with nothing but cedar twigs and some dried meat. He could have chosen the comfortable path once he became a doctor in Chicago. Instead, he carried his knowledge back to the people who needed it most."

I spoke of the night we split ways, the November cold cutting through our clothes. I told them how he studied beneath dim lamps at Fort McDowell school, how he wrote letters for elders long after the agents turned away. I described the pilgrimage we had just completed, how he pressed his hand against the cliff wall and wept for the dead. The faces before me shone with tears. The promise he had asked me to keep beat against my ribs, urgent and steady.

"He told me to keep writing even when the world did not want to read," I said. "He pressed our mothers' memory into my hands and swore me to carry it forward. I will keep telling the story he charged me to finish. His voice did not end here."

A murmur of assent rose from the circle. Chehata began a closing prayer, her arms lifted. When the song faded, we settled in for the night watch. Some people dozed, heads resting on shoulders. Others tended the fire or brewed coffee thick enough to stand a spoon in. I walked outside once to breathe the cold night air. The stars hung low over the desert, sharp as obsidian points.

Morning brought a thin frost that crisped beneath our boots. We prepared Carlos for burial while the women dressed in woven skirts, their hair braided with red yarn. The men wrapped scarves around their throats to meet the chill. I lifted Carlos carefully with the help of my sons. We wrapped him in a thick wool blanket lined with cedar boughs so the earth would receive his scent. His physician's coat lay across his chest, white against the dark weave. We tied the fabric at his shoulders and feet, sealing him in warmth one last time.

Outside, a procession gathered. Grandchildren held baskets of desert marigold and brittlebrush. Riders lined up their horses. Elder singers stood at the front, staffs planted in the earth.

We began the walk to the Cemetery just after noon. The sky stretched clear and hard blue. Dust rose in slow swirls around the procession. Yavapai songs started the march, high and steady. The melody threaded through the canyon breeze, neither overwhelming nor faltering.

As we neared the cemetery, I saw the newly built mound where we had reburied our ancestors weeks before. The grave dug beside it gaped open, raw earth waiting. The sight steadied me. Carlos would rest next to the ones we had brought out of the canyon. The dead would no longer be scattered.

At the graveside, the elders formed a half circle. We lowered him with slow ropes, the blanket swaying gently between us. I stepped forward with my grandchildren. Together, we scattered the desert flowers over the wool. The petals flashed gold against the dark weave. Before the first shovel struck, I reached into my pocket and drew out the bead shell. I slipped my hand beneath the blanket and set it against his chest, close to his heart, whispering his name so only he could hear.

"Cousin," I said, voice carrying across the gathered crowd, "you carried this shell for our people. I return it to you now so you never journey without them. I promise to carry the story you trusted me with. I will not let the world forget."

The first shovels of earth tapped the blanket before the soil gathered thick over him. The sound of soil settling became a rhythm. After the last mound of earth was smoothed, Chehata laid a woven sash across the grave. The elder singers closed with a prayer for safe passage to the other side.

When the crowd thinned, I remained beside the grave with Chehata. Wind tugged at the brim of my hat. The cottonwoods along the wash whispered in the afternoon light. I traced the outline of the mound with my boot, feeling the ground firm beneath each step. "He is home, he is with his family," I whispered.

We returned to the house as twilight spread lavender across the sky. Inside, the rooms were crowded with family. Pots of stew bubbled on the stove. My daughters organized plates in neat rows, their movements a mirror of their mother's. Voices overlapped, low and reverent. The grandchildren played a game of stones in the corner, their laughter subdued but resilient.

After we ate, we gathered in a wide circle on the floor. Chehata sat beside me. I looked at each of my children: Solomon, tall and broad; Carlos Jr., named for the man we had just buried; Katie with her quick eyes; Charlotte and Lula, both married now yet still carrying the gentleness of their childhood; Josie, the youngest, her hands folded tightly in her lap. Around them sat their spouses, their children, their cousins. Three generations filled the room.

"He told me to keep writing even if the publishers turned away," I said. "He told me that the witness belongs to all of us. "Those pages hold the bones of our people in another form. They need your voices to bring them to life whenever mine grows tired."

We must stand guard over this story together.

The night deepened. One by one, the grandchildren fell asleep against their mothers. The older ones volunteered to take turns stoking the fire so neither Chehata nor I would have to rise every hour.

When the house finally quieted, I stepped outside. The moon hung low, casting a pale path over the yard. In the distance, I could see the fence that bordered the cemetery. I imagined the shell resting against Carlos's chest, the weight of soil above him, the nearby mound of ancestors we had returned to the earth. The night air smelled of cedar and damp earth. I felt the promise I had spoken earlier settle inside me like a stone placed to anchor a foundation.

I went back inside and sat at the table. I rested my hand on the physician's bag and felt the shelter of everything we had done: the pilgrimage, the burial, the vow. The story would continue because we would not let it fade. "I will keep telling it," I whispered. "For you, cousin. For the children sleeping under this roof and for the ones beneath the cottonwood."
