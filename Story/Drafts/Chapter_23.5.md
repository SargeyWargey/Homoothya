# 23.5  |  BECOMING WHOLE

### Late April 1922
### Fort McDowell Reservation, Arizona
Outside, the yard had warmed. I looked back once through the open window. Sunlight caught the white cloth around the pages. I felt exposed leaving them there, as if part of me remained on the desk. I walked away quickly before I changed my mind and scooped them back into my arms.

I had several hours to fill before returning. I walked toward the Verde River to keep myself from pacing outside Carlos's door. The smell of damp earth rose from the fields irrigated by canals I had helped dig. Farmers already bent over seedlings, their hats rising and falling like birds. In the distance, the Mazatzal ridges sat purple against the lightening sky. I stood at the edge of the riverbank and listened to the slow current slide past cottonwoods. The sound reminded me of Beaver Creek before the army came.

I could not stay still. Memories stirred and pushed me along the water's edge. Each step carried me deeper into recollection. I thought of the day in 1872 when Carlos and I were separated. I thought of the scout who dragged me away from the cave. I thought of the nights in Prescott when I stared at the ceiling and wondered if anyone from our camp still breathed. With the manuscript now in Carlos's house, those questions had a new shape. We had lived. We had two names. We had two paths that brought us back to one point.

Around noon, the sun blazed high. I sought shade beneath a cottonwood and ate the tortillas and dried apples Chehata had packed for me. She thought of everything. When the mission bell near the school rang three times, I brushed crumbs from my coat and started back toward Carlos's lane.

The front door stood ajar when I arrived, propped with a chair to invite the breeze through the hallway. Carlos called from inside for me to come in. His voice sounded thick.

He stood behind his desk when I entered. The cloth lay open, the pages spread across the surface in a careful stack, the corners weighted with paperweights so the afternoon breeze would not disturb them. He had pushed his spectacles up onto his forehead. His eyes were red and swollen. He did not bother to hide the tears.

For a moment, we only looked at each other. Then he shook his head slowly. "Brother," he said, voice hoarse. "You did not tell me you would cut open the world."

I swallowed hard. "I tried to be honest."

"You succeeded," he said. He pressed his hand to the stack of pages. "I reached the cave just now. I had to stop because I could not see the lines through the water in my eyes."

He pulled out the chair beside the desk and motioned for me to sit. When I did, he placed the top pages in front of me, his finger tapping the paragraph where I described the soldiers levering boulders over the rim. "When I read this, I heard what you heard from that ridge," he said. "I heard the stone grind and shatter. I had tried to believe you dreamed it. Your words proved it was real. I am grateful and I am grieving."

We sat together in the close parlor while the house settled around us. A breeze pressed the curtain against the frame. Somewhere in the kitchen, a kettle clicked as it cooled. Inside the room, time slowed.

We spoke the names of our family aloud, taking turns like a prayer. Mother. Father. Grandmother. Nashta. Baby Yava. We described the way each voice sounded, the way they laughed, and the foods they cooked. We had avoided speaking their names together for fifty years. Saying them now filled the room with presence. I felt their attention like a breeze on the back of my neck.

"I carried their names like stones in my pockets," I admitted. "Heavy. Always there. I was afraid that if I took them out to look at them, they would crumble. Writing them kept them whole."

"You carried them for both of us," Carlos said. "While I ran across the country fighting for rights in Washington, you stayed close to the land and the old ones. You kept our language alive. You married Chehata. You raised children who know who they are."

"And you fought in those cities so they could one day read what I wrote," I replied. "Your speeches opened doors, my words will walk through. We both did what we could."

We fell silent. Afternoon light striped the floor through the shutters. The smell of sage medicine drifted from a room down the hall. Carlos leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. "We should go home," he said after a moment.

"We are home," I said, confused.

He shook his head. "Not this home. The first one. The cliffs, the river, the cave. We have written the story on paper. Now we need to stand in the place where it happened and speak it aloud with the wind listening."

The idea had hovered in the corners of my mind ever since I began the manuscript. Hearing him say it gave it shape. My stomach tightened. Part of me wanted to refuse. The land carried ghosts. Another part leaned toward the thought like a plant toward sunlight.

"Do you think you can manage the ride?" I asked. His cough had worsened in recent months. Tuberculosis had settled in his lungs despite the tonics he brewed. A journey to the Salt River would not be simple.

"We will need supplies," I said, trying to think through the practical steps so the fear would not take hold. "Horses. Tents. Dried food. Permits from the reservation agent so they do not think we are stirring up trouble."

"I will write the agent," Carlos said. "He will listen. He owes me for the time I treated his son without pay."

I will speak with Chehata tonight. If she agrees, we can leave once the heat breaks this winter."

Carlos's smile widened. "She will see the necessity before either of us. She always has."

We sat with the plan between us like a small fire. Each detail we named fed it more fuel. By the time Carlos cleared his throat to remind himself to take his tonic, we had sketched a rough route: depart Fort McDowell with dawn, follow the Apache Trail to rest his lungs, then cross into the canyon lands where our people had sheltered. Just the two of us would travel; no one else needed to bear the weight of what we meant to do. We would stand at the rim above the Cave and speak the names of our dead into the afternoon wind. We would carry tobacco and cloth to tie in the branches above the river. We would bring the bones of our people back so they could rest in the soil that still knew their names. We would place our hands on the rock to feel the resonance of fifty years of silence and break it.

When Carlos rose, his knees cracked. Age had crept into our joints, yet purpose straightened his back. He clasped my shoulders. "Do not doubt the power of what you wrote," he said. "It will carry us as surely as any horse."

I gathered the manuscript back into the cloth so the pages would remain clean. Carlos hesitated, then placed his hand atop mine on the bundle. "Leave it here tonight," he requested. "I want to read it once more before sleep and again when dawn comes."

"Keep them," I said.

"I will guard them as carefully as I ever guarded my patients," he promised.

We embraced. It was not a quick clasp of hands but a full hold that drew me against his chest. I felt his ribs through his thin frame. His breath rattled slightly. I pressed my cheek to his shoulder. We had not held each other like this since we were boys huddled for warmth on that march north. "We survived," I whispered.

"We survived," he echoed. "Now let us make sure the world understands what that survival cost."

Evening shadows stretched long across the agency road as I walked home. The heat of the day lifted. Dust hung in the air, turned golden by the lowering sun. Children tossed pebbles into a circle drawn in the dirt. Someone sang in Yavapai near a cook fire. The sounds of the community wrapped around me like a blanket.

When I reached our gate, Chehata stood waiting with her hands on her hips, flour dusting her apron. She read the answer on my face before I spoke. "He read it," she said.

"He read it. He wept. We made plans," I said, still stunned by the way the afternoon had unfolded.

She drew me inside. The house smelled of stew and fresh bread cooling for the sons and daughters who visited on Sundays. Tonight, the table held only two bowls. We ate quietly, the scrape of our spoons the loudest sound, and I told her what I could while the plan for the pilgrimage sat between us like a glowing coal.

After supper, the house settled into the quiet that still startled me. Chehata and I returned to the kitchen table. She listened as I described every detail of the day. When I told her of the journey Carlos wanted, she closed her eyes and nodded slowly.

"You have carried this return in your bones for years," she said. "Go. Stand on that rim. Speak their names so the land hears the truth from your own mouth. I will keep the household steady while you are gone. I will pray for the land to be gentle."

"I am afraid," I admitted.

"Courage is not the absence of fear," she said. "It is walking toward it with the truth in your hands. You already did the hardest part when you wrote those pages."

Night settled softly around the house. A thin sliver of moon rose over the cottonwoods. I lay in bed beside her and listened to her breathing while the images of the day replayed in my mind: the signatures on white paper, her hand on my neck, the sound of Carlos's voice thick with tears, the resolve in his words when he spoke of returning to the land. I felt the boy I had been sit up within me, no longer locked away. He looked around my life with curious eyes. He recognized the woman who kept us alive. He recognized the cousin who had become a brother. He recognized the road leading back to the red cliffs. For the first time, he did not flinch.

Before sleep took me, I whispered the names of the dead into the darkness. Each name left my mouth like a glowing coal. Each coal floated above us and filled the room with soft light. By the time I closed my eyes, the light had woven itself into a net sturdy enough to carry us eastward when winter came.

The world beyond our door still turned with indifference. Trains would haul soldiers and supplies. Politicians would sign papers that said we were citizens now. Newspapers would debate whether Native words belonged in print. Yet inside our small house at Fort McDowell, truth settled into ink and cloth. It breathed through the lungs of survivors. It rested in the hands of a woman who believed in both of us. It pointed unerringly toward a canyon where we would speak it aloud. I held that knowledge close and let it lull me to sleep.
