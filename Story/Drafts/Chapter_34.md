# THE MANUSCRIPT'S SILENCE 

### 1934-2000s

After Mike's death in 1934, his manuscript was preserved in the archives of the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona.

Sharlot Hall, the woman Mike had first contacted on January 6, 1910, seeking publication help, had kept his papers. She died in 1943, nine years after Mike. The manuscript remained in the museum's archives, occasionally consulted by researchers but unpublished.

Seventy-six years passed from Mike's death in 1934 to the first publication in 2010, seventy-six years of silence.

During this time, mainstream Arizona histories continued to describe the Skeleton Cave incident, when they mentioned it at all, from the Army's perspective. A battle against hostile Indians. A necessary engagement. Casualties regrettable but justified. Some accounts inflated the threat posed by the Yavapai or minimized the number of women and children killed. Others simply omitted the event entirely, erasing it from the historical record.

Mike's eyewitness testimony, the only firsthand survivor account, remained unknown to the general public. Students in Arizona schools learned about pioneers, cavalry, and the taming of the West. They did not learn about Hoomothya, the boy who watched his family massacred. They did not learn about Mike Burns, who spent his life trying to make them listen.

The name "Skeleton Cave" itself tells part of this story.

After the 1872 massacre, the bodies of victims were left in the cave. Between 1905 and 1908, rancher Jack Adams, led a group to the site. A photographer named Lubken took pictures of the remains still scattered across the cave floor. These photographs circulated. The site became known as Skeleton Cave, the name entering maps and local lore.

The name referred to physical evidence, the bones visible to visitors. But for decades, the full story of what happened there on December 28, 1872, remained obscure. The bones spoke, but the context, the humanity, the truth from the Yavapai perspective stayed buried.

Worse than silence, the site was looted.

From 1905 to 1911, during Roosevelt Dam construction, the cave was desecrated. Artifacts and human remains were removed as souvenirs. In 1984, a Phoenix outdoor writer was photographed with illegally taken material from the site. Metal detectors were used. The cave floor was dug down three feet or more, treasure hunters searching through the grave of nearly 80 people.

The site was not protected as a sacred place or massacre location until much later. This desecration continued for decades, another layer of violence against the Yavapai dead.
