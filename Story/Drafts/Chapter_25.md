# 25  |  ONLY ONE

### December 29, 1872
### March North
I woke to the rattle of harness buckles and the scrape of metal against metal.

For a moment, I didn't know where I was. I expected to hear Grandmother stirring the morning fire, Nashta whispering songs to her doll. Instead, I heard soldiers cursing softly as they rolled their blankets, horses blowing steam into the cold air, the huff of the Pima scout who had guarded me through the night.

Dawn hadn't reached the canyon rim yet. The eastern sky was only a pale gray, the color of exhausted ash. Smoke still drifted from the direction of the cave. It smelled of black powder and wet stone and burnt hair.

I curled tighter in the army blanket someone had thrown over me sometime in the dark hours and tried to disappear. My body remembered how I'd fallen to the ground the evening before and refused to move afterward. If I stayed still enough, maybe they would forget me when they left. Let me sink into the dirt and become part of the canyon.

Boots crunched nearby. A shadow fell over me. The scout grunted. "Up," he said in Yavapai.

I didn't move.

The scout crouched and hauled me upright by my arm.

The world tilted when I stood. Spots crowded my vision. Hunger knotted my stomach, but the thought of food made me sick. All I could taste was smoke and dust and blood that wasn't mine.

Across the camp, Captain Brown spoke with two of his lieutenants. His voice was calm, clipped. Orders. Half the soldiers were already mounted, their horses shifting impatiently. The other half loaded pack mules, cinching straps, checking weapons. No one looked toward the canyon.

No one except me.

Smoke still seeped from the cave mouth far below. The cliff around it was streaked black. I couldn't see inside from this distance, couldn't see the bodies, but my mind supplied the missing pieces. The shape of the woman who had run with a bundle clutched to her chest. The way she had fallen and curled. The way the soldiers had gone inside afterward to finish anyone still breathing.

My legs trembled. I might have fallen again if not for the scout's grip.

Hoofbeats came from the west, steady and measured. The soldiers straightened instinctively. Another column approached along the mesa trail, the sun catching the brass on their bridles. At their front rode a white horse, taller than any animal I'd ever seen. Its coat glowed in the weak light. The same horse I had seen a day before on the rim.

The officer on its back wore a dark coat with gold bars on his shoulders. More bars than Captain Brown. More gold everywhere: buttons, braid, sword hilt catching the light.

Captain Brown walked out to meet them. The two officers greeted each other in English, words I couldn't understand but tones I could. Brown reported. The newcomer listened, expression set like stone. When Brown finished, the white-horse officer's jaw tightened. He nodded once, then looked past Brown toward me.

Their voices dropped. Brown pointed in my direction. The newcomer frowned. Said something that made Brown's mouth flatten into a hard line. Brown shook his head. The newcomer spoke again, sharper. Brown hesitated, then motioned for me to be brought over.

The scout pushed me forward. My feet dragged through dust. Every step felt like it pulled threads out of my chest.

When we reached the officers, Captain Brown didn't speak to me. Didn't even look directly.

The officer dismounted in one smooth motion. Up close, I saw that he was much older than Brown, with lines at the corners of his eyes, a mustache streaked with gray. His boots were polished despite the dust. He removed his gloves before he approached me.

He spoke in English first, slow and careful. The sounds meant nothing. He tapped his chest once, the gesture sharp. "Captain Burns," he said, the name cutting through even if the rest of his words blurred. Seeing my blank stare, he turned to one of his troopers. "Get the interpreter."

A different scout trotted over. Not Pima. He smelled of smoke and familiar herbs. His Yavapai was different but understandable. "He says his orders say you come with him. He says he will take you north. He says you will be safe."

Safe. The word hollowed out my chest. My family lay in the canyon below, their bodies still warm in the smoke, and this man talked about safety.

Captain Burns crouched so his eyes were level with mine. He didn't reach out. He just looked. There was something in his gaze I couldn't read, pity maybe. Or calculation. Maybe both.

My tongue felt thick. When I tried to form words, nothing came out. My throat had gone dry sometime in the night and hadn't recovered.

Captain Burns stood and nodded to his men. They brought his horse forward. He swung into the saddle, then leaned down and held out his hand.

I stared at it.

The scout nudged me. "Go," he said.

My legs moved without my permission. My hand lifted. The officer's glove-less grip was warm and strong as he hauled me up. In one heartbeat, I was sitting behind him, the white horse's back broad beneath me, the world swaying.

Captain Burns reached back and settled my hands against his belt. "Hold," he said, the single English word clear enough. I held because if I didn't, I would fall.

He gave a command. The white horse obeyed, stepping forward, weaving through the disassembled camp. The troops fell in behind us. Captain Brown saluted as we passed, his face unreadable.

We rode past the piles of spent cartridges, past the place where the soldiers had stacked their blankets. I clamped my eyes shut as we neared the rim, but the smell still hit: burnt flesh, wet ash, the sour tang of death. I swallowed bile and forced my gaze toward the horizon instead.

As we left the mesa, I looked back one last time. A raven circled above it, riding the currents.

The column turned north.

The white horse moved differently from the army ponies I'd seen before. Each step smooth, powerful. Captain Burns rode with the ease of someone who'd done this his whole life. His back stayed straight, his shoulders relaxed. I sat stiff behind him, every muscle braced.

The morning air cut through my thin shirt. The blanket had been left behind in the scramble. I shivered, but not from cold alone. My skin felt too tight, my bones hollow.

We passed the twisted juniper that looked like an old man bending over his staff. A week ago, I'd walked past that tree with my family, Grandmother's bundle digging into my shoulder. Today I passed it on a white horse, but the tree didn't care. Its branches still twisted toward the sky, indifferent to the war that had burned beneath it.

The red rocks stacked like a giant's cairn rose ahead. From below, they'd looked like a warning. Now, from horseback, they looked like a wall I couldn't climb. I felt something tear inside as we rode by. A thread, maybe. A binding to the land that couldn't hold against horseflesh and iron.

We stopped at the spring where we always filled our waterskins.

Captain Burns swung down and lifted me from the saddle. My legs buckled when my feet hit the ground. He steadied me with one hand, then guided me to the water. "Drink," he said.

I shook my head.

He waited.

My throat burned. Accusing dryness clawed all the way down to my stomach. Eventually, I knelt, filled my hands, and brought water to my mouth. It tasted of limestone and moss and the ghosts of my family. The swallow hurt, but I took another because my body demanded it.

When I stood, Captain Burns offered dried meat. I turned away. He didn't press it, merely tucked it into a pouch hanging from his saddle.

We rode on.

The sun climbed. Shadows shortened. The land shifted from broken canyon rim to rolling hills. The soldiers spread out in a practiced formation, scouts ranging ahead, the main body moving steady as a river.

Every mile peeled another layer from me. My soles left prints in the dust, and with each impression I imagined a piece of my soul staying behind, trapped in that footprint, refusing to follow the white horse any farther.

We passed the wash lined with cottonwoods whose leaves had turned brittle gold. As we rode by, the cottonwood's leaves rattled in the breeze like bones. I pressed my forehead against Captain Burns's coat and breathed in leather and sweat, anything to drown out the sound.

The afternoon stretched long. My muscles ached from riding. My mind floated somewhere outside my body, hovering above the column, watching a boy sit rigid behind a stranger as the only world he'd ever known fell away behind him.

At midday, we stopped long enough for the soldiers to eat. Captain Burns dismounted and pulled me down again. He led me to the shade of a mesquite and crouched so we were eye level. His mustache twitched as he searched my face, perhaps hoping to find understanding there.

He spoke softly. The interpreter translated each phrase with care.

"My name is James Burns. I command Fort Whipple in Prescott.

"I am taking you north with me," the interpreter continued. "There will be a doctor. Food. A bed." His voice shifted, sympathy coloring his words even if they weren't his own. "He says his wife will see to you. She is kind. You will have clothes. You will learn English."

English. Words that meant nothing yet but would come to define my life.

I stared at the dirt between us. It was the same color as the soil around the cottonwood. The same fine dust that clung to moccasins, that settled in the folds of our blankets, that we patted down over our buried belongings. Here it coated army boots and spurs, the wheels of supply wagons, the hems of blue coats.

Captain Burns waited. When I didn't respond, he sighed quietly. He stood, hesitated, then did something no other soldier had done since they captured me. He reached out and almost rested his hand on my head. His fingers hovered a moment above my hair, then he let his hand fall to his side and walked back to his horse.

We rode until the light turned gold. Long shadows stretched across the land. Somewhere in the distance, coyotes called to each other, thin songs on the evening wind.

When we made camp, the soldiers moved with weary routine. Tents erected. Fires sparked. Horses rubbed down. Captain Burns dismounted and lifted me to the ground. He pointed to a spot near his own tent. "Here," he said.

A soldier brought another blanket. He wrapped it around me carefully, tucking the ends so it wouldn't slip. Someone else set a tin cup of broth in my hands. I sniffed it, wary. The smell was unfamiliar, rich and greasy. My stomach lurched.

Captain Burns sat on a camp stool a few paces away, his posture still formal even at rest. He removed his hat, ran a hand through his hair matted from the day's ride, and stared into the fire. The flickering light softened the lines of his face.

When the interpreter approached again, Captain Burns straightened. He spoke a long time this time, sentences flowing faster, his voice low so only we could hear. The interpreter's brow furrowed as he tried to keep up, but he did.

"He says from now on you will stay with him," the interpreter translated. "He says the Army will not send you to San Carlos with the others. He says he has petitioned to have charge of you. He says he will treat you as family. He says you need a new name."

My head snapped up. "I have a name," I snapped before I could stop myself. My voice cracked on the words, raw from smoke and disuse. Hearing my own language after a day of silence startled me.

The interpreter blinked. Captain Burns tilted his head. His eyes sharpened. "Tell him," he said.

He shook his head slightly. Spoke again. The interpreter's expression shifted to something like regret.

"He says in his house, you will be called Mike. It is an Irish name." Mike.

The name landed like a stone in my stomach. Heavy. Unyielding. It didn't fit my mouth. It didn't fit my skin. It felt like the blade that had been pressed to my throat two nights ago, forcing me to give up the path to the cave. Only this time, the blade was hidden inside a word.

Captain Burns watched me carefully. Waiting. Maybe he expected gratitude. Maybe he expected resistance. He got neither.

Inside my skull, something cracked. A quiet, clean break. Hoomothya splintered around the edges, pieces of the boy who had hunted rabbits with his father, who had teased Nashta beside the spring, who had listened to Grandmother's stories beneath the cottonwood. The pieces slid into the dust, scattered along the trail we'd ridden, buried under hoofprints and army wheels.

I lowered my head. My voice was barely a whisper, more breath than sound. "Yes, Captain."

The interpreter repeated the words in English. Captain Burns nodded, satisfied. He stood, adjusting the sword at his side. "Good boy," he said.

I stared at the fire until the flames blurred. The broth cooled untouched in my hands.

When the night deepened and the soldiers' voices faded to murmurs, I lay down on the blanket and faced the endless dark to the south. Somewhere beyond it, crows still flew above the canyon. Somewhere beyond that, the cottonwood stood guard. Somewhere beyond that, Grandmother's stories echoed against stone no one else would ever hear.

Behind me, Captain Burns slept beneath canvas, breathing slow and steady. The white horse shifted on its picket line and snorted softly, as if dreaming.

I lay in the space between. No longer Hoomothya. Not yet whatever Mickey was supposed to be.

Only one boy left alive to carry seventy voices. Only one boy with no place to set them down.

Above me, unfamiliar stars burned as cold as the cup in my hands.
