### Early 1923
### Fort McDowell
We reached Fort McDowell while the sky still held the last stain of sunset. The horses stumbled with weariness, and the pack mare swayed beneath the weight of the bundle wrapped in wool. Chehata waited near the gate with a lantern cupped in her palm. The light threw a gold circle across the hard-packed yard. When she saw the cloth in my arms, she lifted her face toward the stars for a heartbeat, then crossed the distance between us.

She steadied Carlos first. His boots slipped when he dismounted, and the cough that shook him forced him to lean against the saddle. Chehata slid beneath his arm and helped him stand. The smell of cedar clung to her shawl. She pressed her forehead briefly to his chest before turning to me. I did not speak. She did not ask. Her fingers touched the blanket and felt the careful knots that held the bones we had promised to carry home.

Inside the house, the air held the warmth of stew and fresh bread. Chehata set bowls on the table and poured broth rich with venison and hominy. My hands shook so badly that the spoon clattered against the tin rim. She noticed. She took my wrist and held it until the trembling eased. Carlos sat opposite me, his face pale under the lamplight, cheeks hollowed by the journey. He tried to steady his breath before he spoke.

"Tell me what to do with the bundle," Chehata said.

"We will take it to the old burial ground at first light," I answered. My voice rasped, more wind than sound.

She nodded. Her eyes searched mine as if reading the story I was not yet ready to speak. "Did you find what you were seeking?" she asked.

I swallowed. "I found the place where the boy I was had to stop running. The bow he left there is still waiting. It is still too hard to talk about." That was all I could give her. It was enough. She squeezed my hand and turned back to the stove, letting the silence stand between us without filling it.

After supper, she tucked blankets around Carlos while he rested on the pallet near the hearth. The cough came in waves that bent him nearly double, yet when it passed, his eyes shone with something brighter than fever. He hummed a melody so old I had only ever heard fragments of it in San Carlos. Chehata joined the song under her breath while she rubbed juniper salve into his chest.

When the house settled into quiet, I carried the bundle to the cool pantry, away from the stove's heat, and laid it upon cedar boughs. I whispered each name we had spoken in the cave. The room smelled of crushed needles and cold earth. The weight of the package pressed into my palms like a heartbeat.

I lay beside Chehata that night and felt the tremor in my muscles slowly fade. Sleep came in fits. Each time I closed my eyes, the narrow ledge and the roar of the Salt River rose beneath me. Each time I woke, Chehata's hand rested against my chest as if to keep my heart from fleeing back into that canyon.

At dawn, she was already stoking the stove and soaking linen in warm water. "I am sending the boys to the ranches," she said. "The people will gather by sunrise. We will not let those bones rest alone."

Word spread faster than the river. Families arrived bundled in coats, their faces solemn, eyes rimmed with sleep. The elders carried cedar branches and prayer songs; the younger ones brought shovels and carved poles. Carlos insisted on walking despite the cough tearing at his lungs. He looped his arm through mine, and we moved slowly toward the rise west of the agency where our people had begun to lay their dead after the return from exile.

The sun broke the horizon as we reached the clearing. Frost still traced the grass, glittering silver around the pit we had dug before the pilgrimage. Chehata stood at the head of the open earth holding a bowl of water dipped from the Verde River. She touched the surface with her fingertips and flicked droplets toward the bundle. "Come home," she whispered.

We lowered the wool-wrapped bones into the ground while the elders sang. The song rose and fell like the river's current. I felt each word against my skin. Carlos placed his hand on the bundle and closed his eyes. His lips moved silently, forming names that belonged to both of us. I pressed my palm to the blanket beside his. The weight of our hands together anchored the past to the present.

When the prayers ended, we covered the bundle with earth. Children carried cedar to the mound and laid it in a crosshatch pattern taught by their grandparents. Smoke from the ceremonial fire wound upward, carrying the scent of sage, juniper, and sweetgrass. Chehata placed a small pot of cornmeal at the base of the mound. "Rest here," she said. "Your sons have brought you home."

We gathered by the fire afterward, passing cups of bitter tea to warm our hands. Carlos sat wrapped in a wool blanket, cheeks flushed from the cold and from the exertion. He smiled in a way I had not seen since we were boys chasing quail along the river. For a moment, the illness shrank, and the joy of the ceremony filled the space where his hacking cough usually lived.

That evening, the house held the hush that follows a great labor. Carlos rested near the hearth, his eyes half closed. Flames threw shadows across his face. I sat beside him and fed the fire with mesquite logs.

"It is finished for them," he said, voice thin yet steady. "Now we must finish the witness for the living."

I nodded. The manuscript sat on the table beside us, pages stacked in the cloth cover Chehata had sewn. The journey to the cave had settled something in the words. They felt heavier now, as if the bones had given them substance.

Carlos reached for his physician's bag, where it rested near his feet. The leather was cracked from years of desert air. He set it on his lap, opened the clasp, and removed the stethoscope, the worn ledger of patient names, the small bottles of tincture. He placed each item carefully on the floor beside him. When the bag sat empty, he lifted the manuscript, smoothed the cloth cover, and laid it inside before closing his palm over the worn handle.

"Take it," he said, resting the closed bag across my knees. "Carry it when you carry the manuscript. Let them see that a Yavapai man can bear both medicine and testimony."

The gesture struck me harder than any order he had ever given. I wrapped my fingers around the handle. The leather felt warm from his palms. "This is yours, you take it everywhere," I protested.

"Do you truly want me to take your bag?" I asked. "It carries your whole practice."

"It has always been ours," he replied. "My lungs will not see another spring. Your words will." He coughed, swallowed, and continued. "You will bring the story and the proof of our pilgrimage to Sharlot Hall. She must hear it from your own mouth while she can still look into your eyes."

"Then I will carry it," I said. I closed the clasp. The promise settled like a stone in my chest.

Chehata entered with a pot of chamomile tea. She heard the last words and set the pot beside the fire. "He will go," she said. "I will keep you tended while he is away."

The next days passed in a rhythm of care and preparation. Carlos grew weaker, yet his spirit seemed to brighten. He asked Chehata to teach him the lullaby her grandmother had sung. He hummed it between coughing fits. He sorted his papers, labeling letters he wanted the Fort McDowell school to keep for future students. When the pain in his chest made speech difficult, he squeezed my hand. The pressure said everything.

I left for Prescott on a cold morning a week after the reburial. Frost cracked beneath the wagon wheels as I rode toward the rail station in Phoenix. Carlos insisted on walking me to the gate despite the chill. He stood wrapped in the wool blanket, physician's scarf tucked at his throat. His cough bent him, but did not break his gaze.

"Speak plain," he urged. "Do not let anyone soften the edges."

"I will speak the truth," I promised. I lifted the physician's bag. "I will carry you in with me."

The train ride north rattled my bones. I watched the desert flatten into open plains and then rise into juniper hills. Snow clung to the shadowed sides of the Bradshaw Mountains. The town of Prescott bustled with soldiers, ranchers, and shopkeepers. The smell of coal smoke and horse sweat had not changed.

Sharlot Hall welcomed me into her parlor with eyes sharp and kind. She wore a dark dress with cuffs smudged by ink. Stacks of history lined the walls.

She motioned me to sit near the small fireplace. "Tell me everything."

I set the physician's bag across my lap, lifted the clasp, and the manuscript rested on top as he had placed it. Beneath the folded pages, tucked against the lining, lay the small beach shell I had given him when we split paths years ago, the same shell my mothers pressed into my hand and tied to my wrist. The sight punched the breath from me and replaced it with something solid. He had carried that shell through every winter and drought, keeping our mothers' strength close. I let that knowing travel up my arms before I lifted the manuscript free.

I untied the bundle and laid the pages on her table. The indigo cloth caught the firelight. I set the pouch of river sand beside it. My hands moved without shaking. The weight of the shell steadied my spine as I began at the moment we left Fort McDowell for the cave, describing the descent, the bones, the cottonwood with the grinding stones, and the reburial at sunrise. I recited the names of the dead who had been carried in that wool blanket. Sharlot listened without interrupting. Tears slipped down her cheeks, and she did not hide them.

"I will carry this to the editors I know," she said when I finished. "I will speak on your behalf at every historical society meeting I attend. I cannot promise their hearts will be open. The country is tired of hearing what it has done to you. But I can promise that I will try."

"We have lived with broken promises," I replied. "I am asking you for effort, not certainty."

She nodded slowly. "Then effort you shall have." She placed both hands on the stack of pages as if swearing an oath. "Leave the manuscript here for a time. I will copy passages and send them east. I will send word as soon as I hear any answer."

I hesitated only long enough to feel the ache of letting the pages out of my sight. Then I pushed the bundle toward her. "Guard them. They hold the bones of our story."

I closed my fingers around the handle and felt the shell press against the leather from within. Its quiet strength moved through me like a current.

I left Prescott before dawn the next morning. Snow fell in quiet flakes as the train rolled south. My thoughts traveled faster than the rails, racing to the house where Carlos waited.

When I reached home two days later, Chehata met me at the door with dark circles beneath her eyes. "He tires easily," she said. "But his mind is clear. He wants to hear every word of your visit."

Carlos sat propped against pillows, breathing shallowly. His smile broke the tight line of pain across his face. I told him how Sharlot had wept, how she promised to fight for the story, how she had pressed her hands to the pages. His eyes closed as if savoring each image.

"Good," he whispered. "Now I can rest."

The days that followed slipped into a quiet vigil. I read to him from his own speeches and from the letters his patients had written. Chehata brewed willow bark tea, though the bitter medicine no longer eased the pressure in his chest. At night, he asked me to sit close while he slept. He said the sound of my breathing calmed him. I counted each rise and fall of his chest, willing it to continue.

Nearly three weeks after we returned from the pilgrimage, the desert air shifted. A storm brewed somewhere beyond the Mazatzal range. The night was thick and still. Chehata and I fell asleep exhausted while Carlos rested in the front room. I woke to her hand shaking my shoulder.

"Mike," she whispered. Her voice carried a softness I had only heard when our babies were born. "Wake up."

My heart lurched. I followed her to the doorway. Carlos lay on the pallet, the blankets neat around him. His face had smoothed. The lines of pain had eased. His chest did not rise.

Chehata knelt beside him and laid her palm gently over his heart. I took the hand that had once pulled me from floodwaters and held it between my own. It was still warm. The silence in the room rang louder than any river. Tears burned my eyes, but for a long moment I could not release them. The boy named Hoomothya and the man named Mike Burns knelt beside our cousin and let the quiet settle.

"He went easy," Chehata murmured. "His breath just slowed until it stopped. He looked toward the window before he left. I think he saw the ones waiting for him."

I bowed my head. "We carried them home," I whispered. "Now he has gone home too."

We sat through the remainder of the night keeping watch beside him. The fire dimmed to embers. Outside, a coyote called once and then fell silent. The house that had held his voice still seemed to hum with the echo of his last song. I placed the physician's bag beside the pallet. The shell rested inside, the last gift from our mothers running like a vein through Carlos's life and now through mine. It would travel with me in the morning when I told the people. It would rest beside him when we prepared him for burial. It would remind me that the story he entrusted to me now lived entirely in my hands.
