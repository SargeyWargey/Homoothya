# Chapter 8: Six Days

The second day was worse than the first.

I woke stiff and cold on the hard ground, my wrists still bound, my body aching from lying on stone. The soldiers were already moving around the camp, rolling up blankets, checking weapons, preparing to march.

One of them—the one called Hayes—brought me water and a piece of hard bread. I drank the water but couldn't eat the bread. My stomach was too tight with fear and grief.

"Come on, boy," he said gently. "You need to eat. It's going to be a long day."

I turned my face away.

He sighed and left the bread beside me. "Suit yourself."

They untied me long enough to let me relieve myself behind some rocks, two soldiers standing guard as if I might run. Where would I run? I didn't even know where I was anymore.

Then they tied me again and put me on a horse. Not my own horse—we didn't have horses. This was a huge animal that smelled of sweat and leather, and I sat in front of a soldier who held the reins and kept one arm around me to make sure I didn't fall.

Or escape.

We rode all morning. I tried to memorize the way, tried to keep track of landmarks so I could find my way back if I got free. But the country all looked the same after a while—rocks and scrub and endless sky.

My body swayed with the horse's rhythm. The soldier behind me didn't speak. Around us, the column moved in formation—twenty mounted men, their rifles catching the sunlight, their faces hard and weathered.

Captain Burns rode at the front, sitting straight in his saddle, occasionally consulting with another officer. He hadn't looked at me since the first day. Hadn't spoken to me. I was just cargo to him. A tool, maybe. Or insurance, like I'd heard him say.

We stopped at midday to rest the horses. The soldiers ate their rations—more of that hard bread, some dried meat, water from canteens. Hayes brought me food again.

"You ate yet?" he asked.

I shook my head.

"You're going to make yourself sick, not eating." He broke off a piece of the bread and held it out. "Just a bite. Come on."

I took it because I was hungry despite everything. The bread was tasteless and hard, but I chewed it and swallowed. Hayes smiled.

"That's better. See? Not so bad."

But it was bad. Everything was bad. I was a prisoner of men who'd probably killed my people, or were planning to, and I was eating their food and riding their horses and there was nothing I could do about it.

The afternoon was worse than the morning. The sun beat down hot despite it being December. My head ached. My wrists burned where the rope rubbed against my skin. The horse's movements made me nauseous.

I tried not to think about where we were going. Tried not to imagine my family in the cave, wondering where I was, whether I was alive or dead.

But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

***

The third day I tried to escape.

It was stupid. I knew it was stupid even as I did it. But we'd stopped to water the horses at a creek, and for just a moment the soldiers weren't watching me as closely as usual, and I thought maybe, maybe if I could just get into the brush, into the rocks, I could hide until they gave up looking.

I made it maybe twenty yards before they caught me.

The soldier who grabbed me wasn't gentle this time. He dragged me back to the camp by my arm, rough enough that it hurt. Captain Burns looked up from where he'd been kneeling by the creek.

"He tried to run, sir," the soldier reported.

Burns stood and walked over to me. He looked down at me with those tired eyes, and for a moment I thought he might hit me. My father would have, if I'd done something so foolish.

But Burns just shook his head.

"Tie his ankles when we ride," he said. "Not tight enough to hurt him, but tight enough he can't jump off the horse."

"Yes, sir."

After that, I rode with both my wrists and ankles bound, and two soldiers watching me at all times. I'd made things worse for myself. And I still wasn't free.

That night they gave me a blanket. I don't know why. Maybe Hayes had said something to Burns about how cold I was. Maybe they just didn't want me to die before I was useful to them.

I wrapped myself in it and lay as close to the fire as they'd let me, and tried not to cry.

But I cried anyway. Silently, so the soldiers wouldn't hear. I cried for my mother and father and sisters. I cried for my grandmother and uncle and all the people in the cave. I cried for myself, alone and terrified and so far from home I might never find my way back.

Eventually I slept.

***

The fourth day they started talking to me.

Not in Yavapai—none of them spoke my language. But in English, slow and simple, pointing at things and saying words.

"Horse," one of them said, pointing at the animal I was riding.

I stared at him.

"Horse," he repeated. "Say it. Horse."

I didn't say it.

"Come on, boy. Horse. Hor-se."

I turned my face away.

But I heard the word. And when he pointed at another horse later and said it again, I understood what he meant.

They did this all day. Pointing at things, saying English words. Water. Sky. Rock. Sun. Man. Boy.

I didn't repeat any of them. But I heard them. And my mind, without meaning to, started connecting the sounds to the things they meant.

Language was a weapon, I was learning. The same as a rifle or a knife. If I understood their words, I'd know what they were planning. I'd know what they were going to do.

So I listened. And I remembered. And I started to understand.

By evening, when Hayes said "water" and held out the canteen, I knew what he was offering. When another soldier said "eat" and gave me bread, I knew what he meant.

I was learning the language of my enemies.

And I hated myself for it.

***

The fifth day it rained.

Cold December rain that soaked through my clothes and made me shiver so hard my teeth chattered. The soldiers had coats and oilcloth covers. I had the blanket, which Hayes draped over my shoulders, but it got wet and heavy and stopped keeping me warm.

We kept riding. The horses splashed through mud. The rain ran down my face and dripped from my hair. I'd never been so cold in my life.

That night they made camp in a stand of juniper that gave some shelter from the rain. They built a fire under a rock overhang and let me sit close to it. My clothes steamed as they dried. My hands and feet ached as the warmth returned to them.

Captain Burns was sitting across the fire, writing in that small book of his. He looked up and saw me watching him.

For a moment our eyes met. I expected him to look away, or to tell me to stop staring. But he didn't. He just looked at me with an expression I couldn't read.

Then he went back to writing.

I wondered what he was writing. A report on the mission? A letter to someone? His own thoughts about capturing a seven-year-old boy and keeping him prisoner?

I'd never know. But I kept watching him when he wasn't looking, trying to understand what kind of man he was. Trying to see if there was any kindness in him, or if he was just another soldier doing a job.

He'd given me a blanket. He'd ordered my ankles tied but told them not to hurt me. He'd let Hayes bring me food and water.

But he'd also captured me. Held me prisoner. Was using me for something, though I still didn't fully understand what.

Was he good or bad? Enemy or protector?

I didn't know. Maybe he was both. Maybe people could be both.

That night I dreamed of my father. He was calling my name, searching for me, his voice getting fainter and fainter until I couldn't hear it anymore.

I woke with tears on my face and the fire burned down to coals.

***

The sixth day we started climbing.

The land changed from flat desert to broken country—rocky hills and deep canyons, juniper and pinyon pine dotting the slopes. The air smelled different here. Familiar.

My stomach tightened.

I knew this country. Not this exact place, but places like it. We were in Yavapai territory now. Our territory.

Which meant we were getting close to...something. Somewhere.

The soldiers seemed more alert too. They rode with rifles ready, eyes scanning the rocks. Captain Burns stopped the column several times to look through his brass tube at the country ahead.

We made camp early that afternoon in a hollow between hills that couldn't be seen from above. The soldiers spoke in low voices. No one built a fire, even though the evening was cold.

Something was going to happen tomorrow.

I sat wrapped in my blanket, my ankles and wrists still bound, and watched the soldiers prepare. They checked their weapons, counted ammunition, talked in voices too quiet for me to hear.

Hayes came and sat beside me. He'd been kind these past days, kinder than he had any reason to be. He looked at me now with something like sadness in his eyes.

"I'm sorry, kid," he said quietly. In English, but I understood the tone if not all the words. "I'm sorry for all of this."

I didn't respond. What was there to say?

He reached out and adjusted the blanket around my shoulders, making sure I was covered. Then he stood and walked away.

Night fell. The stars came out, bright and cold in the clear sky. The soldiers settled in to sleep, but I could feel the tension in the camp. Tomorrow. Something was happening tomorrow.

I lay on my side and looked at the stars and tried to think about anything except what tomorrow might bring.

But there was nothing else to think about.

We were in Yavapai country. The soldiers were preparing for something. And I was their prisoner, bound and helpless and being carried toward something I couldn't name but could feel in my bones.

Something terrible.

***

The seventh day began before dawn.

They woke me in the darkness, untied my ankles, pulled me to my feet. My legs were stiff and barely held me. A soldier—not Hayes this time—pushed a piece of bread into my hands.

"Eat fast. We're moving."

I ate because I was told to. The bread was like dust in my mouth.

Around me, the camp was coming alive in the darkness. Soldiers moving quietly, efficiently, like they'd done this a hundred times before. Checking weapons. Tightening saddles. Preparing for...what?

Captain Burns was standing a little apart from the others, looking at something in the growing light. I followed his gaze and my breath caught.

In the distance, maybe two miles away, I could see a canyon. Deep and dark, with stone cliffs rising on either side.

Salt River Canyon.

My heart started pounding. I knew that canyon. We'd traveled through it, hunted in it, gathered along its edges. And somewhere in those cliffs, hidden high above the river, was a cave.

My family's cave.

They knew. Somehow they knew where my people were hiding.

And they were going to attack.

I tried to run then. Tried to scream a warning even though I was too far away for anyone to hear. But hands grabbed me, held me, clamped over my mouth before I could make a sound.

"Easy, boy," a soldier said. "Easy now."

I fought anyway. Kicked and twisted and tried to bite the hand over my mouth. But I was small and they were strong and there were too many of them.

Captain Burns walked over. He looked down at me struggling in the soldier's grip, and something flickered across his face. Regret? Pity? I couldn't tell.

"Bring him," he said. "Keep him quiet. He comes with us."

"Sir?"

"He comes with us," Burns repeated. "I want him where I can see him."

They put me on a horse again, but this time with my hands tied to the saddle horn and a soldier on either side. I couldn't run. Couldn't fight. Couldn't do anything but sit there as we started toward the canyon.

Toward my family.

The sun was rising now, painting the canyon walls gold and red. It was going to be a beautiful day. Clear and cold and bright.

My people would be waking up in the cave. My mother would be rekindling the fire, my father checking the entrance, my sisters rubbing sleep from their eyes. They'd be safe in the stone shelter, protected by the walls and the height and the difficulty of the approach.

They thought they were safe.

But they weren't safe. The soldiers were coming. And I couldn't warn them.

I couldn't save them.

We rode closer. The canyon walls rose higher. I could see the lava field now, black and jagged at the canyon's bottom. Could see the cliffs where somewhere, hidden in stone, my family slept.

I started crying. Couldn't help it. Silent tears running down my face as we rode closer and closer to the place where everything was about to end.

A soldier saw me crying and looked away. Another muttered something under his breath. Hayes, riding nearby, reached out and briefly touched my shoulder.

But they didn't stop. They didn't turn back. They didn't let me go.

We kept riding toward the canyon.

Toward the cave.

Toward the end of everything.

And I, seven years old and bound and helpless, could only watch it come.
