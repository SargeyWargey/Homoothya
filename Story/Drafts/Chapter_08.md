# CHAPTER 8: RIVER OF RETURN

## 1905-1909

By the summer we committed ourselves to Fort McDowell, the river smelled like crushed willow and wet stone. Families camped beneath mesquite groves that had waited thirty years for our footprints to return. We raised brush homes beside the ditches our grandparents had dug, then set to clearing the silt that had choked them while the Army called this place abandoned. Every shovel stroke felt like turning over a buried heartbeat. The children splashed in the shallows, their laughter chasing dragonflies while we mapped out fields in the same terraces our elders once irrigated.

The agency refused to fund the repairs, so we relied on calloused hands and stubborn memory. Hashduba organized work crews that traded labor the way white ranchers traded cattle. We hauled lumber from the hills and bartered with traders who doubted we would stay. At dawn I met with men whose hair had gone silver in exile, and we measured water flow with willow sticks while my sons fetched rope to brace the canal walls. By dusk the younger boys ran baskets of river mud to patch leaks. We worked with a patience born from promises we had learned not to trust.

Word spread that the Army interpreter had returned, though they said it with a question mark. Some elders still remembered the boy in uniform who spoke English too smoothly, the scout who rode between officers and our own. They watched me step into council circles with my ledger tucked beneath my arm and waited to see whether I would speak for them or for the men who once paid me. Chehata stood at my side without apology. Her presence told the doubters that I answered to our family first.

Most days I carried messages between the people and the Prescott office. Women whose husbands were still listed as scouts, though the jobs no longer existed, asked me to write letters demanding their back pay. Farmers who had managed to coax corn from the revived fields pressed seed heads into my palm and asked me to inform the agent that white ranchers were cutting the irrigation dam upstream. I wrote every petition twice—once to deliver, once to tuck into my ledger. Each copy was proof that we had asked to be heard.

When the heat settled low, we gathered beneath cottonwoods for story nights. Elders who had limped back from San Carlos leaned on walking sticks carved from desert ironwood. They spoke in Yavapai thickened by years spent among Western Apaches, their voices threaded with both gratitude and grief. Grandma Dashkoda described the day General Crook promised they could stay on the Verde "as long as they lived." Her hands shook when she mimed the officers' uniforms, but her eyes were sharp. She named the families that planted wheat in those first hopeful months, then the names of the ones who never survived the sickness that followed. I wrote each name before the lamplight faded, the pencil nub blackening the page with testimony.

Another night, Uncle Wahya traced the march to San Carlos with his toe in the dust. He marked each creek crossing and told how the soldiers rationed flour with a scale that seemed to grow lighter every day. He spoke of the fight near the East Verde, the sudden crack of rifles, the way the blood of Yavapai and Apache Mojave mingled in the same frozen arroyo. My daughters listened wide-eyed, their fingers curled around shells they had gathered that afternoon. When the story ended, they placed the shells at the foot of the storyteller's stool without being asked. They had already learned offerings were owed when memory cost that much to carry.

Chehata insisted the children repeat the names back before they slept. "If you can say them, you can keep them," she told them. After the little ones curled beneath blankets, she set the ledger on the table and checked my spelling. She could not read English letters, yet she knew when a name felt crooked and would make me say it aloud until I placed the sounds correctly. "Write the promise exactly as they heard it," she said. "When the agent reads your petition, he must recognize the words they held onto."

During one of those evenings a trader from Phoenix arrived with a bundle of newspapers. Among them was a thin journal titled *Wassaja*. Carlos Montezuma's name sat bold across the masthead beside the words "Power to the Indian People." The trader said the doctor sent copies for anyone willing to fight for Fort McDowell's land. I read the articles aloud while the men mended harnesses. Carlos wrote about citizenship, about the government starving whole reservations to force compliance, about the right to decide where we lived. His sentences felt like flint striking the steel already smoldering in our camp. I folded the journal carefully and tucked it into the ledger. Somewhere beyond the valley my cousin was shouting at Congress. Along this river, we were building the evidence to echo his shout.

The petitions began to bring inspectors. They rode into our fields with notebooks and skeptical eyes, counting our corrals and measuring our ditches as if proof of our competence might erase our claim. I guided them along rows of barley that shimmered like copper in the afternoon sun. I introduced them to widows who had rebuilt homes on the same plots their husbands farmed before the March of Tears. When the inspectors asked why I bothered recording dates in a ledger no official had requested, I told them every line ensured our grandchildren would know exactly when the government promised and exactly when it failed.

After they left, I read my pages aloud to the elders whose memories had filled them. Some corrected me—"No, that child died before the river crossing, not after"—and I amended the entries until each detail settled true. Others simply nodded and pressed their palms against the paper as if feeling for the pulse of the past. Each affirmation pushed me toward the story I had long avoided. The ledger, once a vocabulary exercise for my children, had become a witness stand.

One evening as the sun slid behind the ridge, the smell of cedar smoke drifted across the camp. It carried me back to the parade ground at Camp Verde, to the day I watched wagons assemble under the shadows of promises already unraveling. I realized that if I wanted my children to understand why we fought to reclaim this land, they needed to walk through those earlier days with me. The stories the elders offered were roots. The march, the broken promise, the sickness—those were the stones that shaped the river's bend.

Before we could plan for the inspector's next visit or dream about a schoolhouse built by our own hands, I had to set down the river's earlier song. Chehata saw the decision land on my shoulders. She placed the ledger back in my grasp and said, "Begin where General Crook spoke. The children can feel the water now. Let them know what it cost to return to it."

So I sharpened my pencil and opened to a fresh page. The lamplight flickered across the faces of my family and the elders who had trusted me with their pain. The next words would carry us back to the promise made on this river and the march that drove us from it. Only then would the fight we waged in the present make its full sense. I lifted the pencil, ready to follow the current upstream.
