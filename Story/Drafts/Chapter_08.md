## PART I: THE RIVER OF RETURN (1905-1909)

By the summer we committed ourselves to Fort McDowell, the river smelled like crushed willow and wet stone. Families camped beneath mesquite groves that had waited thirty years for our footprints to return. We raised brush homes beside the ditches our grandparents had dug, then set to clearing the silt that had choked them while the Army called this place abandoned. Every shovel stroke felt like turning over a buried heartbeat.

The agency refused to fund the repairs, so we relied on calloused hands and stubborn memory. I organized work crews with men whose hair had gone silver in exile. We measured water flow with willow sticks while my sons fetched rope to brace the canal walls. By dusk the younger boys ran baskets of river mud to patch leaks. We worked with a patience born from promises we had learned not to trust.

Word spread that the Army interpreter had returned, though they said it with a question mark. Some elders still remembered the boy in uniform who spoke English too smoothly, the scout who rode between officers and our own. They watched me step into council circles with my ledger tucked beneath my arm and waited to see whether I would speak for them or for the men who once paid me. Chehata stood at my side without apology. Her presence told the doubters that I answered to our family first.

Most days I carried messages between the people and the Prescott office. Women whose husbands were still listed as scouts asked me to write letters demanding their back pay. Farmers who had coaxed corn from the revived fields pressed seed heads into my palm and asked me to inform the agent that white ranchers were cutting the irrigation dam upstream. I wrote every petition twice—once to deliver, once to tuck into my ledger. Each copy was proof that we had asked to be heard.

When the heat settled low, we gathered beneath cottonwoods for story nights. Elders who had limped back from San Carlos leaned on walking sticks carved from desert ironwood. They spoke in Yavapai thickened by years spent among Western Apaches, their voices threaded with both gratitude and grief.

Grandma Dashkoda described the day General Crook promised they could stay on the Verde "as long as they lived." Her hands shook when she mimed the officers' uniforms, but her eyes were sharp. She named the families that planted wheat in those first hopeful months, then the names of the ones who never survived the sickness that followed. I wrote each name before the lamplight faded, the pencil nub blackening the page with testimony.

Another night, Uncle Wahya traced the march to San Carlos with his toe in the dust. He marked each creek crossing and told how the soldiers rationed flour with a scale that seemed to grow lighter every day. He spoke of the fight near the East Verde, the sudden crack of rifles, the way the blood of Yavapai and Apache Mojave mingled in the same frozen arroyo. My daughters listened wide-eyed, their fingers curled around shells they had gathered that afternoon. When the story ended, they placed the shells at the foot of the storyteller's stool without being asked. They had already learned offerings were owed when memory cost that much to carry.

Chehata insisted the children repeat the names back before they slept. "If you can say them, you can keep them," she told them. After the little ones curled beneath blankets, she set the ledger on the table and checked my spelling. She could not read English letters, yet she knew when a name felt crooked and would make me say it aloud until I placed the sounds correctly.

"Write the promise exactly as they heard it," she said. "When the agent reads your petition, he must recognize the words they held onto."

One evening a trader from Phoenix arrived with a bundle of newspapers. Among them was a thin journal titled *Wassaja*. Carlos Montezuma's name sat bold across the masthead beside the words "Power to the Indian People." The trader said the doctor sent copies for anyone willing to fight for Fort McDowell's land. I read the articles aloud while the men mended harnesses. Carlos wrote about citizenship, about the government starving whole reservations to force compliance, about the right to decide where we lived. His sentences felt like flint striking the steel already smoldering in our camp. I folded the journal carefully and tucked it into the ledger. Somewhere beyond the valley my cousin was shouting at Congress. Along this river, we were building the evidence to echo his shout.

The petitions began to bring inspectors. They rode into our fields with notebooks and skeptical eyes, counting our corrals and measuring our ditches as if proof of our competence might erase our claim. I guided them along rows of barley that shimmered like copper in the afternoon sun. I introduced them to widows who had rebuilt homes on the same plots their husbands farmed before the March of Tears. When the inspectors asked why I bothered recording dates in a ledger no official had requested, I told them every line ensured our grandchildren would know exactly when the government promised and exactly when it failed.

After they left, I read my pages aloud to the elders whose memories had filled them. Some corrected me—"No, that child died before the river crossing, not after"—and I amended the entries until each detail settled true. Others simply nodded and pressed their palms against the paper as if feeling for the pulse of the past.

One evening as the sun slid behind the ridge, the smell of cedar smoke drifted across the camp. It carried me back to the parade ground at Camp Verde, to the day I watched wagons assemble under the shadows of promises already unraveling. I realized that if I wanted my children to understand why we fought to reclaim this land, they needed to walk through those earlier days with me. The stories the elders offered were roots. The march, the broken promise, the sickness—those were the stones that shaped the river's bend.

Chehata saw the decision land on my shoulders. She placed the ledger back in my grasp and said, "Begin where General Crook spoke. The children can feel the water now. Let them know what it cost to return to it."

I sharpened my pencil and opened to a fresh page. The lamplight flickered across the faces of my family and the elders who had trusted me with their pain. I would write it down. I would set down everything I witnessed, everything I was told, everything that must not be forgotten.

This is their testimony, and mine.

## PART II: THE PROMISE (1873-1875)

I set this down so the world may know. The White People have heard only one side.

The first time General Crook spoke the words I carried a pitcher of water taller than my forearm. The general stood in the parade ground at Camp Verde with officers clustered around him and Yavapai leaders gathered across the packed earth. I stayed near the doorway of the adjutant's office as Captain Burns had instructed. The air smelled of horses and damp canvas.

Crook lifted his hands and told them they could live at Rio Verde as long as they lived.

The interpreter voiced the promise in Yavapai. The wind pushed the words toward me before it carried them over the river. I watched shoulders loosen and heads bow. I believed him because the men beside him believed him while they listened.

After that day the parade ground grew quieter. Soldiers still drilled, but more of their energy moved toward the reservation across the river. Freight wagons rattled in and out with sacks of flour and barrels of coffee. Captain Burns kept ledgers detailing every pound issued. He showed me how to copy numbers into columns and how to sum them without smearing ink across the page.

At night I stacked the ledgers on the edge of his desk so he could study the lists of wheat, barley, and corn harvested by the people who had surrendered. I did not cross the river to see their fields, yet the reports painted them almost clearly: rows of green shoots, irrigation ditches trimmed by careful hands, granaries filling.

When officers praised the results, pride tugged at me. I swallowed it before anyone could see.

I carried covered dishes to meetings where agency officials explained ration allotments. They spoke of flour, sugar, beans, bacon, and fresh beef. They spoke of the need to keep order and maintain records. They did not speak of the dances and songs that drifted across the river at night, but I heard them anyway when I slipped outside to empty slop buckets. The music rode the water until taps sounded and I was expected back inside.

Sometimes Captain Burns sent me to the quartermaster to fetch cloth or medicines. The doctor kept bottles of tinctures lined up like soldiers. His name was Williams. He entered the post only rarely, yet everyone knew his handwriting. It slanted across requisitions for quinine, poultices, laudanum.

When sickness rippled through the reservation in the second year, his name traveled faster than any medicine.

Men arrived at the post with red-rimmed eyes and voices hoarse from grief. They said whole families lay still inside brush shelters. They said children burned with fever until dawn and no one could cool them. They said Dr. Williams had poisoned them.

The accusation hung in the air like smoke. No officer answered it directly. They argued instead about clean water and proper sanitation. Their voices were tight with worry or anger or both. I stood in the doorway and tried to read whether the poison was on their hands or only in the distrust between them and the people outside the fence.

Death moved with relentless patience. Each time I ferried blankets or paper to the agency, someone else was missing from the group that once waited by the gate. I recognized mothers who had helped my own grandmother grind mesquite, cousins who had traded stories by firelight, men who had hunted alongside my father.

They looked through me when I approached in Army clothes, yet grief softened their eyes for a moment. We shared that softness in silence. I was still a boy, still bound to the post, yet the loss carved lines inside me that matched the ones deepening in their faces.

One afternoon Captain Burns returned from the agency with his shoulders bowed. He removed his hat, set it on the table, and told me close to half the people at Rio Verde were gone. He said disease had done what bullets had not. He did not know how to reconcile that truth with the promise he had heard Crook swear.

He asked for coffee even though the day was warm. I poured it without spilling and carried the cup to him. He thanked me. Neither of us spoke again that evening.

I record these memories now so my grandchildren will know that trust was not lost in a single instant. It frayed quietly while wheat sprouted and while officials praised the farmers they intended to displace. The promise failed before anyone marched. It failed when disease thinned the lodges and the doctor defended himself with paper instead of healing. It failed each time a settler's letter weighed more than the lives counted in my ledgers.

What I did not witness directly, I learned later from those who survived. I name them here: Grandma Dashkoda, Uncle Wahya, Mary Johnson, John Williams. Their words are truth.

They told me how the air smelled sweet with orange blossoms before the sickness came. They described the taste of wheat they had grown themselves and the day the ration beef turned sour in their mouths. They remembered the doctor moving from shelter to shelter with bottles that offered no relief. They said Crook's promise echoed like a cruel joke every time someone died in the night.

As they spoke, I heard again the clink of Captain Burns's inkwell, the scratch of his pen as he tried to reconcile casualty numbers with the assurances he had written in earlier letters. Their grief matched the fragments I had gathered long before, and the two halves of the story locked together like the teeth of a trap.

By the time orders arrived to abandon Rio Verde, the foundation had already been dug out from beneath us.

All that remained was to watch the roof collapse.

## PART III: THE MARCH (February 1875)

"As long as they lived" became two years.

The day the column formed, frost clung to the shaded side of the adobe wall. Soldiers moved quietly, the way men move when they know a promise has cracked and they do not wish to hear it shatter again. Captain Burns told me to stay near the commissary. I obeyed long enough to watch wagons loaded with sacks of flour, barrels of salt pork, and coils of rope. Then I slipped along the fence line until I could see the people gathered beyond the parade ground.

Families stood with bundles tied in blankets. Some carried clay pots, some carried tools, all carried the weight of disbelief. Two winters earlier they had been told they could remain in the Verde Valley as long as they lived. Now an officer I did not know repeated the words of a new order: they would go to San Carlos. If they behaved, they could return in five to seven years.

The second promise sounded thin even as he spoke it.

I knew, even at age ten, this was a lie. They never intended to let my people return.

I recognized faces in the crowd. Mothers balanced cradleboards on their backs. Men who had surrendered their weapons after the canyon now leaned on walking sticks, bodies weakened by sickness and grief yet ready to march if it meant staying together. The smell of cedar bundles, the sharp tang of tanned hides, and the sweet smoke of last-minute fires drifted toward me. The soldiers smelled of oil and gunpowder.

I stood between those scents and felt pulled in both directions.

When the column moved out, no wagons carried people. Wagons held supplies and weapons. The people walked.

Snowmelt slid down from the mountains and turned the road into a ribbon of mud. Captain Burns rode near the front. He waved me forward and told me to ride behind him. Lieutenant Bishop, newly assigned to Camp Verde, nodded permission. I climbed into the saddle of a mule usually reserved for errands.

I traveled with the soldiers who forced the march. I was fed while my people starved. I rode while they walked. I was warm while they suffered.

I could do nothing. I was ten years old, in the care of the men who were destroying my people's lives.

But I remembered everything.

We crossed the Verde River before noon. The water was cold enough to numb feet within seconds. Soldiers on horseback pushed forward through the current while families linked arms to steady one another. The river swelled against their legs. I saw a girl stumble and vanish beneath the surface. Her mother screamed. A scout swung down from his horse and dragged the girl back into the shallows. She coughed up water and clung to her mother's waist.

The officers called for faster movement. Their orders echoed off the canyon walls and scattered the wails into fragments.

The march stretched into a rhythm of dawn fires, hurried meals, long hours of walking, and restless sleep beneath army blankets. Rations dwindled faster than expected. Flour sacks tore open, and precious handfuls of grain spilled into the dust. Beef issued at the start turned sour. Soldiers tightened their belts but still had coffee each morning. The people who walked beside us chewed parched corn saved from their own stores.

When a boy of five collapsed near the tenth camp, his father asked an officer for a place in a wagon. The officer refused. There was no wagon space for the living.

On the twelfth day we reached the East Verde River. Tension had simmered for miles between Tonto families and the Apache Mojaves and Yumas who walked beside them. Old grievances rubbed raw under hunger and fatigue. As we halted to refill canteens, a shout cracked through the air. Someone struck first. I never learned who.

The fight surged like wildfire. Men who had carried relatives moments before now raised knives and clubs. Women screamed. Soldiers tried to force separation, but the riverbank channeled the violence into a narrow corridor.

I saw Al Sieber, the chief of scouts, ride straight into the fray, shouting orders in English and Yavapai. A rifle flashed. Sieber grabbed his stomach and fell from the saddle. Blood soaked his shirt. He survived, but the wound twisted his stride for the rest of his life.

By the time officers regained control, thirty or more Tontos lay dead on the rocks.

The survivors gathered their bodies in silence. We marched again before the earth could cool.

Each night I lay close to the Army fire, the better to hear orders relayed for the next day. Each night my thoughts walked among the campfires of the people being driven from their homeland. I wanted to crouch beside them and share the food hidden in my saddlebag, but soldiers watched me as if waiting to see where my loyalty rested.

I stared into the flames until sleep finally dragged me under. Dreams carried me to the canyon where I had led the soldiers and to the green valley we now left behind. In both places, echoing cries chased me while I ran without finding shelter.

Some mornings we rose to sleet that stung skin raw. Other mornings the sun glared off wet ground and blinded horses. Small children learned to walk in step with soldiers because a misstep could bring a rifle butt against their shoulders. Elders wrapped themselves in every scrap of cloth they owned.

I heard prayers whispered for mountains, rivers, and the spirits of ancestors who had promised protection. The prayers carried the names of landmarks that lived in my bones as surely as any that belonged to the Army.

The officers around me complained about the cold and the delay. The people around them mourned every mile that separated them from the Verde.

The closer we drew to San Carlos, the more the land flattened. The mountains that framed the Verde Valley shrank behind us. Word spread through the ranks that the reservation held other Apache bands who spoke different dialects and did not welcome newcomers.

No one cheered when the Gila River finally came into view.

The people walked across the boundary in silence. An official from the Indian Bureau stood waiting with a ledger. He counted heads as if the march had been an inventory exercise. He wrote down numbers while families searched for space to build shelters among strangers.

When the last tally mark was made, the officer who had announced Crook's second promise declared the journey complete. He did not mention the dead left along the road or the years that would stretch far beyond the seven he had offered.

I dismounted and stood on the dry ground of San Carlos. The wind carried grit and the faint smell of unfamiliar cook fires.

I whispered farewell to the water, trees, and rocks of the Verde. Good-bye my homeland. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land.

I was wrong. I did come back.

And I am writing this so my people's suffering will not be forgotten.

## PART IV: FULL CIRCLE (1905-1909)

Years later, when I returned from Highland and sought out the people who had endured the march, they told me stories that matched what I had witnessed from the saddle. They spoke of shoes that fell apart within days, of children carried on shoulders until fathers collapsed, of elders buried in shallow graves because the march could not pause long enough for proper rites.

They told me the second promise had been a lie meant to quiet them. None of them ever saw the Army escort arrive to lead them home. They found their way back to the Verde only decades later, walking by choice this time, carrying the memories of those who had not survived.

I set down every name they gave me. Every person who died because of broken promises. This is the accounting the government will never make, so I make it.

News from Dr. Carlos Montezuma reached Fort McDowell through his journal *Wassaja*. He was shouting in Washington about our rights while we proved ourselves here on the land. His words gave us courage. Our fields gave his words weight.

When federal inspectors toured Fort McDowell's thriving irrigation systems, I presented ledger evidence of Yavapai competence, self-sufficiency, determination. I showed them the wheat and barley we had raised on land they said was worthless. I showed them the children learning to read and write. I showed them proof that we had done everything asked of us.

They could no longer pretend we were incapable.

I witnessed the promises made. I witnessed the promises broken. I witnessed my people's exile. Now I witness their return to the Verde River.

I am writing this because I am the only one living who was present at Rio Verde, present on the March, and present now at Fort McDowell.

This is my testimony.

Let the White People read it and know what was done.

If I write the words "good-bye my homeland" now, it is because I felt the land pulled from beneath my feet even while I sat a horse and wore Army clothes. The officers called me by the name Burns. The people in the column looked past me as though the name belonged to someone else.

The truth lived in the ache that settled under my ribs with every mile. The land carried the bones of my ancestors. Leaving it felt like leaving them unguarded.

I carried that ache into every year that followed, and it guides my hand as I set these memories on the page so the promise and its betrayal will not be forgotten.

My children listen now as I read these pages aloud. They understand why we fight for this river, this land, this home. They know the cost of promises made by men who never intended to keep them.

They will remember. They will teach their children to remember.

And when the government comes again with new promises, my grandchildren will hold this testimony in their hands and measure every word against what their people have already survived.

That is why I write.
