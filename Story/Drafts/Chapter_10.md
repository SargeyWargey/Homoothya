# Chapter 10: Only One

I don't remember most of the first part of the journey away from the canyon.

The horse moved beneath me. The sun crossed the sky. Soldiers talked in low voices around me. But I was somewhere else. Somewhere dark and far away where the sounds couldn't reach me.

Where I didn't have to see my mother falling.

Where I didn't have to hear the boulders crushing bone.

Where I didn't have to know what I'd done.

We rode north at first. Away from the Salt River. Away from the canyon. Away from the sealed cave where my family's bodies would lie for decades, maybe forever.

I'd heard numbers through the scouts' broken words. Seventy-six dead, they'd said.

But I knew better. I'd been in that cave. Had seen it full of people. My father had counted close to two hundred when we'd first arrived. Women. Children. Elders. A few men.

All dead now.

All because I'd whispered "cave."

All because I'd walked at the front of the column, leading soldiers to my family.

But then, as we traveled, the land began to change. Began to look familiar in a different way.

This wasn't the country around the cave. This was older memory. Deeper.

We were passing through the lands where I'd grown up. Where my family had fled from when my father first saw the soldiers coming. Before we went to the cave.

The white officer—the one who'd stayed on the mesa, the one who'd taken responsibility for me—he rode a big horse ahead of the column. One of the scouts gestured to me, and I was lifted up to ride behind this officer on his horse.

I sat behind him, small and hollow, as we rode through country I knew.

There. That valley where we'd camped two winters ago. Where Mother had dug wild onions and Nashta had learned to weave her first basket.

There. That stand of mesquite trees. I'd climbed them with my cousins, gathering beans, laughing when someone fell.

There. That flat area with the smooth rocks. I could see where the grinding stones would be if I dug there. Grandmother's grinding stone, Mother's, my aunt's. All buried when we fled. All waiting for people who would never come back.

There. That oak tree, twisted and old. I'd climbed it last spring to knock down acorns. Had sat in its branches eating them, watching hawks circle overhead.

Everything was the same. The land hadn't changed.

But everything was different. Empty. Silent.

No smoke rising from cooking fires. No children playing. No women singing as they worked. No men returning from hunts.

Just empty land that remembered us. That held our stories in every rock and tree and valley.

I rode through my childhood on the back of a white man's horse, seeing everything I'd lost.

All of it gone. All of it ended.

And I was the only one left who remembered.

Night fell. We made camp. Someone put food in my hands but I couldn't eat. Gave me water but I couldn't drink. Wrapped me in a blanket but I couldn't feel warmth.

I was hollow. Empty. Everything that had been Hoomothya had died back in that canyon.

What was left wasn't really alive. Just a shell. A witness. A walking ghost.

The white officer sat across the fire from me. He looked older in the firelight. Lines deep in his face. Eyes tired.

Through one of the scouts, he told me I should eat.

I didn't respond. Didn't move.

He sighed through the scout's translation. Stood. Walked away.

But later, when I was lying on my side staring at nothing, he came back. Sat down near me. Not touching, but close.

He spoke in English for a long time. I didn't understand most of the words. But I understood some. Through the scout's broken translation, I caught pieces.

War. Over. Suffering. End. Reservation. Fed. Peace.

Peace. That word I'd heard before from the scouts.

The peace of death. The peace of graves. The peace of a sealed cave full of bodies.

That was the only peace the Army had brought.

The scout translated more of what the officer said. Boy. Not your fault. Captured. Threatened. Survive. No blame.

But I blamed me.

And I would blame me forever.

The officer fell silent. After a while, he stood and walked away again.

I lay there and stared at the stars. The same stars that had watched my family die. The same stars that would go on shining long after everyone who remembered this day was gone.

Everyone except me.

I was the only one left who knew their names. The only one who carried their stories. The only one who would remember that they weren't just "seventy-six dead hostiles."

They were people. My people.

My mother, who sang while she ground mesquite beans.

My father, who taught me to track deer and read the land.

My grandmother, who told stories that went back to the beginning of the world.

My sisters—Nashta and the baby whose name she'd barely learned.

All of them dead. All of them sealed in stone.

And I was alive.

The only one living to tell.

But who would want to hear it? Who would care that a Yavapai boy had watched his family die? Who would listen to a story about what soldiers did to people hiding in a cave?

The Army would write their report. Seventy-six hostiles killed. Resistance ended. Mission accomplished.

That would be the story people heard. The official story. The one that mattered.

My story—the truth—would die with me. Just another lost voice in a war the winners would write about in their history books.

Unless I found a way to tell it. Unless I made them hear.

But I was eight years old. Barely spoke English. Had no power, no voice, no way to make anyone listen.

All I could do was survive. Remember. Carry the weight.

And hope that someday, somehow, I'd find a way to make the truth matter.

***

The second day we met up with a larger column. More soldiers, returning from other operations. They greeted Captain Burns's group with satisfaction. The Tonto Basin Campaign was succeeding. Resistance was crumbling. Peace was at hand.

Their peace. Not ours.

One of the officers noticed me. Through a scout, he asked who I was.

Through the same scout came the answer from the officer who'd taken me: "Survivor from the cave. Taking responsibility for him."

The officer looked at me with curiosity. Not sympathy. Not horror at what I'd been through. Just curiosity, like I was an interesting artifact.

He said something in English, amused. The scouts laughed a little as they translated it to each other.

The officer who'd taken me responded. I caught one word through the scouts' talk: "civilize."

Civilize. As if my people were savages. As if Grandmother's stories and Mother's songs and Father's wisdom were somehow less than what these men in their uniforms had to offer.

But I said nothing. I was learning that survival meant silence. Meant accepting their words even when they cut like knives.

Meant becoming someone else to stay alive.

That night, the officer who'd taken responsibility for me called me over to his fire through the scouts. He had paper and a pen. He wrote something, then showed it to me.

Through gestures and one of the scouts' broken Yavapai, he made me understand: "Mike Burns." Pointing at the letters. My name now.

I looked at the marks on the paper. They meant nothing to me. Just shapes.

But they were my name now. Mike Burns. Not Hoomothya.

Through the scouts, he told me more. School. Carlisle. Learn to read and write English. Learn a trade. Make something of myself.

Make something of myself. As if what I'd been before wasn't enough. Wasn't valuable. Wasn't worth preserving.

But maybe he was right. Maybe Hoomothya wasn't worth preserving. Maybe that boy deserved to die for what he'd done.

Maybe Mike Burns would be better. Would carry less guilt. Would sleep without seeing his mother fall.

I didn't believe it. But I didn't argue.

Over the following days, as we traveled north toward the fort, the scouts spoke to me more. Taught me some English words. Soldier. Horse. Food. Water. Yes. No. Simple things.

The soldiers talked around me in English. I understood almost nothing at first. Just sounds.

They said the Skeleton Cave operation was the turning point. That after this, the Yavapai resistance would collapse. That soon all the bands would surrender, go to reservations.

They were right. Over the next months, I would learn, the remaining Yavapai gave up. Turned themselves in. Chose reservation life over being hunted.

Chose survival over freedom.

Just like I had.

But I was learning. Slowly. Picking up words. Beginning to understand what they said when they thought I couldn't hear.

And in 1875, they would force-march the remaining Yavapai to San Carlos. More than a hundred would die on that march. More death. More loss.

But I wouldn't be with them. I would be with this officer—this man whose name I would later learn was Burns. Captain James Burns.

I would learn English. Learn to be civilized. Learn to be Mike Burns instead of Hoomothya.

Learn to survive in the world that had destroyed mine.

We reached the fort on the third day. Soldiers dismounted, started unloading equipment, settling back into garrison life.

Through the scouts, Burns told me to come with him. He took me to the quartermaster. Got me different clothes—not the Yavapai clothes I'd been wearing, but white boy's clothes. Shirt. Pants. Boots that didn't fit right.

I put them on because I had no choice. Looked at myself in a piece of polished metal the quartermaster used as a mirror.

I didn't recognize the person looking back.

It wasn't Hoomothya. That boy was dead.

It wasn't quite Mike Burns yet either. That person hadn't fully formed.

I was something in between. Something broken. Something that had lost everything and gained only survival.

The only one living to tell.

But not yet. Not for years would I find the words. Find the courage. Find the way to make people hear what I'd seen.

For now, I was just a boy in strange clothes, following a man who'd taken me from everything I knew, learning to answer to a name that wasn't mine.

For now, I was just surviving.

Carrying the weight.

Remembering.

The only one left who knew what really happened in that cave above the Salt River on December 28, 1872.

The only one who would spend the rest of his life trying to tell it.

**Historical notes:**
- Mike Burns became Captain James Burns's ward after the massacre
- The Skeleton Cave Massacre marked the turning point in the Tonto Basin Campaign
- Most remaining Yavapai surrendered over the following months
- In 1875, approximately 1,500 Yavapai were force-marched to San Carlos; 102 died
- Mike would later be sent to Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1880
- The process of forced "civilization" and name change began immediately after his capture
- Mike's determination to tell his story and bear witness began in these early days, though it would be decades before he could write it down
- The discrepancy between official Army reports (76 dead) and Mike's recollection (around 225) remained a source of pain and frustration throughout his life
