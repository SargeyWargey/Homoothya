# Chapter 10: Skeleton Cave

The gunfire started before I understood what was happening.

Sharp cracks echoing off stone. Multiplying. Becoming a roar that filled the canyon and the cave and the inside of my head until there was nothing else in the world but that sound.

Screaming. People screaming inside the cave. High voices. Women. Children.

I tried to pull away but hands held me. Not rough. Just firm. Keeping me there on the ledge in front of the cave entrance.

"Don't look," someone said. Hayes maybe. "Don't look, boy."

But I was already looking. The gag was out of my mouth now and I could have screamed but no sound came. My throat was closed. My whole body was frozen.

Smoke drifted out of the cave mouth. Acrid. Bitter. The smell of gunpowder mixing with something else. Something sweet and copper that made my stomach heave.

The soldiers were firing into the cave. Standing in a line along the ledge and the slope above, aiming down into the opening, pulling triggers again and again. Reloading. Firing again.

Some aimed at the roof. I didn't understand why at first. Then I saw the bullets spark off the stone ceiling and angle down. Ricocheting. Killing people who thought they were sheltered.

There was nowhere to hide. The cave that was supposed to protect them had become a trap.

A woman ran toward the cave entrance. I saw her for just a moment in the smoke. Dark hair streaming. Hands reaching out.

She fell.

Something small moved near the cave mouth. A child. Maybe four years old. He stood there with his thumb in his mouth, looking out at the soldiers with wide eyes. Not crying. Just staring at the guns like he didn't understand what they were.

A soldier lowered his rifle. Couldn't shoot a baby.

But someone else did.

The child crumpled.

I made a sound then. Not a scream. Something animal. Something from deep in my chest that had no words.

Hayes's hands tightened on my shoulders. "I'm sorry," he said. "God, I'm sorry."

But he didn't stop it. None of them stopped it.

***

I don't know how long the shooting lasted. Time had no meaning anymore. There was only the sound of rifles and the screams that got quieter and quieter until they stopped.

Then there was just the ringing in my ears. And smoke. And the terrible smell.

Captain Burns walked past me toward the cave entrance. He moved carefully, rifle ready, checking for anyone still alive who might fight back.

But there was no one left to fight.

He looked into the cave for a long moment, his face unreadable. Then he turned and gestured to his men.

"Secure the area. Count the dead. Look for survivors."

Survivors. As if there could be any.

Soldiers moved into the cave. I heard their boots on stone. Heard their voices, lower now, some of them sounding sick.

"Jesus Christ."

"They're all women and children."

"There's a baby here. Can't be more than—"

"Don't. Just don't."

Burns looked down at me. His face was gray. Old. He opened his mouth like he was going to say something, then closed it again.

What was there to say?

I pulled free from Hayes and ran toward the cave entrance.

"Boy, no—" someone called, but I didn't stop.

I had to find them. Had to find my mother, my father, my grandfather, my little sister. Had to see if maybe, somehow, they were all right.

The cave was dark after the brightness outside. I stumbled over something and fell. My hands landed in something wet. Something warm.

Blood. The floor was slick with it.

I pushed myself up and kept going deeper into the cave. My eyes were adjusting. I could see shapes now in the dimness. Bodies. Everywhere.

Some I recognized. Old Nanchu who used to make my sister laugh. She was lying with her arms around two small children, protecting them even in death.

One-Eye, the warrior who had danced at the fire last night. He was sprawled near the back of the cave, his body full of bullet holes.

I stepped over them. Around them. Looking for my family.

I found my grandfather first.

He was sitting with his back against the cave wall like he had just decided to rest. But his eyes were open and empty and there was a dark stain spreading across his chest.

His head was wrong. Part of it was gone, blown away by a bullet or a rock. I remembered what he'd told me about the heads in the rocks. About the spirits that guarded this place.

He'd been right. Death had been here all along, waiting.

"Grandfather," I whispered. But he didn't answer. Would never answer again.

My mother was nearby. I knew her by her dress, the one she'd been wearing when I was captured. She was face-down, one arm stretched out like she'd been reaching for something.

For someone.

I knelt beside her and carefully turned her over. Her face was peaceful. Eyes closed. Almost like she was sleeping except for the blood at the corner of her mouth.

"Mother," I said. My voice cracked. "Mother, please."

But she was gone. They were all gone.

I found my father near the cave entrance, where he must have been trying to defend the others. My aunt was beside him. My uncle was in the back corner, his body shielding two small forms that I couldn't look at too closely.

My little sister. She was so small. Her favorite doll was still clutched in her hand.

I sat down in the middle of them all—my family, my people, my world—and something inside me broke.

Not loudly. Not with screaming or crying. Just a quiet shattering, like ice cracking on a winter stream.

A sound came out of me. Low. Keening. The grief sound that Yavapai women made when someone died. I'd heard it before when old ones passed away. But never like this. Never for everyone at once.

I rocked back and forth, making that sound, and I couldn't stop.

***

Hands lifted me up. Gentle hands. Hayes again, pulling me away from my mother's body.

"Come on," he said quietly. "You can't stay here."

But where could I go? There was nowhere left. No home. No family. Nothing.

He carried me out of the cave into the daylight. The sun was fully up now. The sky was blue and cloudless. Birds were starting to sing in the canyon.

The world was still beautiful. Still going on like nothing had happened.

But everything had happened. Everything had ended.

Burns was talking to his officers. Giving orders. Organizing the men.

Some soldiers were gathering things from the cave. Weapons. Supplies. Evidence of the "hostile" band they'd destroyed.

Others were rolling boulders to the cave entrance. Big stones from higher up the slope. They'd seal the cave, Burns said. Make it a tomb.

Bury the evidence. Bury the dead.

Bury my family and leave them here in the dark.

"No," I tried to say, but my voice wouldn't work. "No, you can't—"

But they could. They did.

I watched them roll stone after stone until the cave entrance was blocked. Sealed. A mass grave for seventy-six people.

Seventy-six. That's what the soldiers counted. Seventy-six dead.

My mother. My father. My grandfather. My grandmother. My sister. My aunt. My uncle.

Everyone.

I was the only one who survived. The only one left to remember their names. The only one who could tell what happened here.

The only one living to tell.

***

They took me with them when they left. Down the slope, across the lava field, up the canyon wall and away from that place.

I looked back once. The cave was just a dark smudge on the cliff face now, the entrance hidden behind the boulders. You wouldn't know anything terrible had happened there unless you'd seen it.

But I had seen it. I would always see it. Every time I closed my eyes.

Burns rode beside me. I was on a horse again, tied to the saddle again, going wherever they decided to take me.

"What's your name?" he asked. In English. I understood the words now—he'd asked me before.

I didn't answer. My name was Hoomothya. But Hoomothya had died in that cave with everyone else.

"I'll call you Mike," he said finally. "Mike Burns. After me."

His name. The name of the man who'd kept me prisoner while my family was slaughtered. Who'd led this attack. Who'd given the orders that killed everyone I loved.

That was my name now.

I didn't protest. Didn't argue. What was the point?

Hoomothya was dead. My family was dead. My people were dead.

I was just a ghost wearing a dead boy's skin. And ghosts don't need names.

The column rode north through the winter sunshine, and I rode with them because I had nowhere else to go.

Behind us, the cave held its dead in silence.

And inside me, I held the memory of their last moments. The sound of their screams. The sight of their bodies.

The weight of being the only one who survived to tell their story.

I didn't know it then, but that weight would never lift. Not in all the years to come. Not even now, sixty-two years later, as I write these words.

I am the only one living to tell.

And that burden is heavier than any stone they rolled across that cave entrance.

Heavier than anything else I would carry in my whole long life.
