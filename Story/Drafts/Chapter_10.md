# Chapter 10: Skeleton Cave

I heard it from miles away.

Bound on the mesa beside my father and my uncle's body, I heard the gunfire begin. Distant. Echoing off canyon walls. But unmistakable.

Sharp cracks at first. Then multiplying. Becoming a roar that seemed to fill the whole world.

The two guards looked toward the canyon. One of them shifted uncomfortably.

My father's keening grew louder. That terrible sound, animal and wounded, that came from somewhere deep inside him.

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. My hands were still tied. All I could do was sit there on the cold ground and listen to my people dying.

The gunfire went on and on. How long? Minutes? Hours? I couldn't tell. Time had stopped meaning anything.

I imagined what was happening down there in the cave. The soldiers firing from above, bullets ricocheting off stone. My mother trying to shield my sisters. Grandmother praying. The children screaming.

All of them trapped with nowhere to run.

All of them dying because I'd told the soldiers where to find them.

My father's keening had stopped. He sat silent now, staring toward the canyon, tears running down his face. His mouth moved but no sound came out. Maybe he was praying. Maybe he was just broken.

I wanted to die. Wanted the guards to shoot me, to end this, to stop me from having to hear what I'd caused.

But they didn't. They just stood there, looking uncomfortable, occasionally glancing toward the canyon where the gunfire continued.

When the gunfire finally stopped, the silence was worse.

One of the guards looked sick. The other wouldn't meet my eyes.

We sat there for what felt like hours. The sun climbed higher. Birds sang. The world went on, indifferent.

Then the soldiers started coming back.

They climbed up from the canyon in ones and twos, their faces grim. Some looked shell-shocked. One young soldier stumbled away and vomited.

Captain Burns came last, his face drawn and gray.

He walked over and looked down at my father and me for a long moment.

"It's done," he said. His voice was flat. Empty. "Seventy-six dead. All women, children, and old men."

My father made that wounded sound again.

Burns's eyes found mine. I saw something in them—not quite guilt, not quite pity. Something complicated and dark.

"Cut their bonds," he told his men. "We're taking them with us."

As they untied my hands, I wanted to ask if I could see them. See my mother. My sisters. My grandmother. Say goodbye.

But I couldn't form the words. And even if I could have, I don't think Burns would have let me.

Maybe that was a mercy. Maybe seeing them would have broken something in me that couldn't be fixed.

Or maybe I needed to see them. Needed that final goodbye. Needed to witness what my words had caused.

I'll never know.

They put us on horses. My father and me, the only survivors. My uncle's body thrown over a third horse.

As we rode away from the canyon, I looked back once. Saw smoke drifting up from where the cave was. Saw the country I'd been born in.

All of it going on without them.

Somewhere down there in that cave, sealed behind boulders the soldiers had rolled across the entrance, lay my mother. My sisters. My grandmother. Everyone I'd ever known.

Seventy-six people dead.

And two left alive to carry the weight of it.

My father and I didn't speak as we rode. What was there to say?

He still wouldn't look at me. The disappointment in his eyes earlier had been replaced by something worse: emptiness. Like he'd used up all his emotions and had nothing left.

Captain Burns rode at the head of the column. Every so often he would glance back at us, his face unreadable.

After several hours, we stopped to rest the horses. Burns came over to where my father and I sat, still bound to our saddles.

"What's your name, boy?" he asked in halting Yavapai.

I didn't answer. My name was Hoomothya. But that boy had died back in the canyon.

"I'll call you Mike," he said finally, switching to English. "Mike Burns. After me."

His name. The name of the man who'd led the massacre. Who'd used the information I gave him to find and kill my people.

That was my name now.

I didn't protest. What was the point?

My father made a sound of disgust and turned his head away.

The column rode on through the afternoon. North, away from the canyon. Away from the cave. Away from everything.

As the sun began to set, painting the desert in gold and red, I looked back one last time. The canyon was just a dark line on the horizon now. You wouldn't know anything terrible had happened there.

But I knew. I would always know.

The sound of the gunfire. The keening my father had made. The silence that followed.

The weight of being partly responsible for seventy-six deaths.

I was seven or eight years old, and I'd helped kill my people trying to save my father.

And now I had to live with that. Had to carry it forward. Had to become whatever came next.

Mike Burns, they called me now. The boy who survived. The only one living to tell.

But inside, where no one else could see, I was still Hoomothya.

Still the boy who'd pointed toward the canyon and doomed everyone he loved.

That boy would never die. Would never leave me. Would haunt every day of the long life ahead.

**[End Chapter 10]**

*Word count: ~850*
*Scene location: Mesa above Salt River Canyon, then riding north*
*Approximate timeframe: December 28, 1872*
*Age: Hoomothya approximately 7-8 years old*

**Historical notes:**
- This revised version maintains emotional distance from the actual massacre, showing Hoomothya hearing it from afar rather than witnessing it directly
- The psychological impact remains devastating—perhaps even more so because his imagination fills in what he cannot see
- Mike Burns's father's fate is historically uncertain; this version keeps him alive initially but separates him from Mike, creating additional emotional complexity
- The burden of survivor's guilt and complicity under duress would have been crushing for a child—this trauma would shape the rest of Mike's life
- Historical accounts vary on exact details of the massacre; this narrative honors the emotional truth of Mike's experience while acknowledging gaps in the historical record
