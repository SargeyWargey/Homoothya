# CHAPTER 10: FIRST CITIZEN

## July 14-15, 1908

---

The Prescott courthouse smelled of furniture oil and old tobacco. I stood at the registration desk with morning light slanting through windows tall enough to make a man feel small. The clerk looked up from his ledger and waited for me to state my business.

"I've come to register," I said.

He glanced at my clothes—clean shirt, hat in hand—then at my face. His pen hovered above the page while he calculated something behind his eyes.

"Under the Burke Act?"

"Yes."

He pulled a fresh form from the stack. The paper crackled as he smoothed it flat. "Name?"

"Mike Burns."

He wrote it without hesitation. I watched the letters form, black and permanent.

"Age?"

"Forty-three."

"Occupation?"

I paused. The honest answers were too many and too complicated. Laborer. Interpreter. Witness. "I work where I'm needed."

He frowned but wrote "laborer" in a cramped hand.

"Place of birth?"

"Arizona Territory."

"Tribe?"

The word sat in the air between us. I could feel it pulling at the careful distance I had spent years building. "Yavapai."

He blinked. His pen dipped again into the inkwell. "You'll need to provide evidence you've severed tribal relations. Can you do that?"

I nodded. The words I carried inside—*I severed nothing. They severed me*—stayed behind my teeth.

"And you've been deemed competent by the Department of the Interior?"

"I have the certificate."

I unfolded the paper from my pocket and laid it on the desk. The clerk read it twice, his lips moving slightly. When he looked up his expression had shifted from skepticism to something harder to name. Curiosity, perhaps. Or the discomfort of a man realizing he was witnessing history and did not know what to do with it.

"You'll be the first," he said.

"The first what?"

"The first Indian to register in the Territory." He said it like he was offering congratulations, but his voice lacked conviction. "The Burke Act's been law for two years. No one else has done it."

I did not tell him that most Native men I knew had no desire to beg for rights that should have been theirs by birth. I did not tell him the Act demanded we prove ourselves "civilized" by abandoning the very people the government had spent decades trying to destroy. I nodded again and waited for him to finish.

He copied information from the certificate onto the registration form. His handwriting grew tighter as the lines progressed. When he reached the final question, he hesitated.

"Political affiliation?"

"Republican."

He wrote it down. Then he turned the ledger toward me and offered the pen. "Sign here."

The nib felt light in my fingers. I had signed government papers before—enlistment forms, discharge documents, land agreements that dissolved like smoke the moment they became inconvenient. This signature felt different. It was not permission to serve or permission to survive. It was a claim. A line drawn in ink that said I existed, I counted, my voice would be heard.

I signed my name.

The clerk blotted the signature and closed the ledger. "You can vote in the next election. Judge Wells is running for Governor. He's a friend to the Indians, they say."

"I know him," I said. It was not quite true. I had met him once at a land hearing where he had listened more than he spoke. That was enough to call him a friend in a territory where most men did not bother listening at all.

The clerk handed me a registration card. My name, my age, my occupation, all reduced to a few lines of type. Proof that Mike Burns—former scout, former student, former prisoner—was now a citizen with the right to cast a ballot.

I folded the card into my pocket beside the certificate and walked out into the Prescott morning.

---

The street was busy with wagons and men conducting business they believed mattered. I stood on the courthouse steps and let the sun warm my face. Somewhere inside I expected to feel different. Transformed. Vindicated. Instead I felt the same weight I had carried into the building, only now it had a new name attached.

*Citizen.*

The word tasted strange. It implied belonging, yet I had spent my life learning that belonging was always conditional. At Carlisle they told us we could belong if we abandoned our languages. In the Army they told us we could belong if we hunted our own people. Now the government told me I could belong if I severed the ties that made me who I was.

I had done all of it. And still I did not belong.

A man passed me on the steps, tipping his hat without meeting my eyes. Another crossed the street rather than walk near me. I understood. The Burke Act might grant me the right to vote, but it could not legislate away the instinct men carried to keep their distance from anything they did not understand.

I thought of Chehata waiting at home. She would ask how it went, and I would tell her I was registered. She would nod and say it was good, that our children would remember their father was the first. She would not ask what it cost to be first, because she already knew.

The cost was written into every requirement of the Burke Act. To gain citizenship I had to prove I was competent—as if surviving Skeleton Cave, Carlisle, and two enlistments was not proof enough. I had to prove I lived apart from the tribe—as if the massacre that killed my family was a choice I made. I had to prove I had adopted "the habits of civilized life"—as if the Yavapai way of life I had known as a boy was something barbaric that needed replacing.

I had proven all of it. And in proving it, I had given the government exactly what it wanted: my silence.

Except I would not stay silent.

I descended the courthouse steps and walked toward the newspaper office. The *Prescott Weekly-Journal Miner* occupied a narrow building that smelled of ink and paper dust. A young man with rolled sleeves looked up from a typesetting table.

"Help you?"

"I registered to vote this morning," I said. "I'm told I'm the first Indian in the Territory to do so."

His eyebrows lifted. "That right?"

"It is."

He wiped his hands on a rag and pulled a notepad from his pocket. "What's your name?"

"Mike Burns."

"And your tribe?"

"Yavapai."

He scribbled notes. "Where'd you learn English?"

"Carlisle Indian School. Pennsylvania."

"Ah." He nodded as if that explained everything. "So you're educated. That's why you qualified under the Burke Act."

"That's why."

"And you severed tribal relations?"

The question landed like a stone in still water. I could answer truthfully and tell him my relations were severed when soldiers killed them in a cave. Or I could answer carefully and give him the story he expected.

I chose carefully.

"I live apart from the tribe," I said. "I've adopted civilized habits."

He wrote it down without questioning what those words meant or what they cost. "You plan to vote in November?"

"I do. For Judge Wells."

"Friend of yours?"

"He's a fair man."

The reporter nodded and closed his notepad. "This'll run in tomorrow's edition. First Indian voter in Arizona Territory. People will want to know about this."

I thanked him and left before he could ask more questions. Outside, the sun had climbed higher. The street noise pressed against me—wagon wheels, voices, the clang of a blacksmith's hammer. I walked through it all feeling like a man caught between two truths.

The first truth: I was now a citizen with the right to vote.

The second truth: I had gained that right by denying the very people whose story I intended to tell.

---

The ride home took most of the afternoon. I followed familiar roads through high desert that had witnessed more broken promises than I could count. By the time I reached the house, shadows stretched long across the yard.

Chehata stood at the stove, stirring something that smelled of onions and salt pork. She glanced over her shoulder when I entered.

"Well?"

"I'm registered."

She set the spoon down and turned to face me. Her eyes searched mine for what the news meant beyond the fact itself. "How do you feel?"

I removed my hat and placed it on the table. "I don't know."

She crossed the room and took my hands. Her fingers were warm from the stove. "Tell me."

"I'm a citizen now. I can vote. They'll print it in the newspaper tomorrow. First Indian in the Territory." The words came out flat, drained of the pride they were supposed to carry. "But to get here, I had to tell them I severed tribal relations. I had to prove I was civilized enough to deserve rights other men are born with."

"You didn't sever anything," she said quietly. "They did that for you a long time ago."

"I know. But I still had to say the words."

She squeezed my hands. "And now you'll use the rights those words bought you. You'll vote for men who listen. You'll write letters they have to answer because you're a citizen. You'll speak for the people who can't speak for themselves yet."

I looked at her and saw the same fierce certainty that had drawn me to her years ago. She had never doubted that I could live in both worlds without losing myself in either. She believed I could be Mike Burns the citizen and still honor Hoomothya the boy who died in a cave so Mike could survive.

"What if it's not enough?" I asked.

"Then we keep trying." She released my hands and returned to the stove. "But first you eat. You've been traveling since dawn."

I sat at the table and watched her move through the kitchen with practiced efficiency. The house smelled of woodsmoke and cooking food and the faint sweetness of wild tobacco drying in bundles near the window. It was home. Not the home I had known as a child, not the home the government tried to force on me at Carlisle, but the home Chehata and I had built together from the wreckage of everything that came before.

This was the truth the Burke Act could not touch: I belonged here. Not because the government said I was competent, not because I had severed anything, but because Chehata and I had chosen each other and built a life that honored both who I had been and who I was becoming.

---

The next morning a neighbor rode by with a copy of the *Prescott Weekly-Journal Miner*. The story ran on the second page under a headline that read: **FIRST INDIAN REGISTERS TO VOTE IN ARIZONA TERRITORY**.

I read it aloud to Chehata while she mended one of the children's shirts.

*"Mike Burns, an Apache Mohave Indian, became the first Indian in the Territory to take advantage of the Act of Congress of 1906, entitling educated Indians who have severed tribal relations to the full rights of citizenship. Mr. Burns, who attended Carlisle Indian School and served as an Army scout, registered at the Yavapai County Courthouse yesterday and intends to vote for Judge Ed. W. Wells in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Mr. Burns is the first of his race to achieve this milestone in Arizona."*

Chehata looked up from her mending. "Apache Mohave?"

"They got it wrong."

"They always do."

I folded the newspaper and set it aside. The reporter had recorded the facts but missed the truth. I was not Apache Mohave. I was Yavapai. My people had been slaughtered in a cave while the government called it a victory. My family had been erased while officers wrote reports praising their own efficiency. And now a newspaper celebrated my citizenship by erasing my identity one more time.

But I had the registration card. I had the right to vote. And I had the determination to use that right in service of the people the newspaper could not be bothered to name correctly.

"Save it," Chehata said, nodding toward the paper. "Someday our grandchildren will want to know their grandfather was first at something that mattered."

I picked up the paper again and smoothed the creases. She was right. This was not the end of anything. It was a beginning.

I had spent my childhood as Hoomothya, learning to track deer and gather mesquite and listen to the stories elders told by firelight. I had spent my youth as Mike Burns, learning English and mathematics and how to survive in a world that wanted to remake me in its own image. I had spent my adulthood trying to reconcile the two, trying to be both Yavapai and citizen, both witness and participant.

Now I had the legal right to speak. The question was whether anyone would listen.

---

In November I rode back to Prescott to cast my ballot. The courthouse was busier this time, crowded with men who took their citizenship for granted. I waited in line like everyone else. When my turn came, the clerk glanced at my registration card and handed me a ballot without comment.

I marked my choice for Governor—Judge Ed. W. Wells, a man who had listened when others turned away—and folded the paper carefully. The ballot box was plain wood with a slot cut in the top. I slid the ballot through and heard it land softly on top of the others.

One vote among hundreds. One voice in a chorus that rarely made room for voices like mine.

But it was a start.

Outside, the autumn air smelled of wood smoke and distant rain. I stood on the courthouse steps and looked out over Prescott's streets. Somewhere in this territory, Yavapai families were rebuilding lives on reservation land the government had promised them temporarily and would try to take away permanently. Somewhere, children were learning English in boarding schools designed to kill the Indian and save the man. Somewhere, elders were dying with stories no one had bothered to record.

I could not save them all. I could not undo the massacre or bring back the dead or restore what had been stolen. But I could vote. I could write. I could witness.

I could be the first.

And if I was the first, others would follow. Slowly, painfully, against the current of a government that preferred us silent and invisible. But they would follow.

I descended the steps and mounted my horse. The ride home would take hours, but Chehata would be waiting. She always was. And tonight, when the children asked what I had done, I would tell them I voted.

I would tell them their father was a citizen.

And someday, when they were old enough to understand, I would tell them what that citizenship cost, and why it mattered anyway.
