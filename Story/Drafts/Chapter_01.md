# CHAPTER 1: LEARNING TO BE AMERICAN

## 1873-1874

The uniform scratched. Mrs. Burns had sewn it herself from blue wool cloth, copying the soldiers' uniforms but making it small enough to fit a boy. She said I looked handsome in it. She said I looked like a proper young man. She did not say I looked like myself, because I no longer looked like myself at all.

I stood in the parlor of the quarters at Fort Whipple, trying not to scratch where the wool rubbed against my neck. Captain Burns sat at his desk reviewing papers. His daughter Katie played with a doll on the floor. Mrs. Burns—Annie, she insisted I call her Annie—was teaching me to set the table for supper.

"Fork on the left, Mickie," she said gently. "Knife and spoon on the right."

Mickie. That was what they called me now. Lieutenant Thomas had written Mike Burns in the ledger and then given me that nickname. "Mickie would be at least one Irish Indian in the land that would become Arizona!" he'd said, and the soldiers had laughed, and that was what they shouted across parade grounds and kitchens. Before that I had another name, but I kept it locked away.

I placed the fork on the left side of the plate. I focused on each lesson as if precision could anchor me. Here, what mattered was forks on the left and standing straight when the Captain entered the room and speaking English.

The English came quickly. I learned it the way you learn to swim when you are thrown in the river: you learn or you drown. Within months I could understand most of what was said to me. Within a year I could speak it well enough that the soldiers stopped talking about me as if I were not there.

"He's a smart one, that Indian boy," Lieutenant Thomas had said to Captain Burns.

"He is," the Captain agreed. "He'll do well, with proper guidance."

I was standing right there, polishing the Captain's boots. They talked about me as if I were a horse being broken to saddle. Perhaps that is what I was.

Captain Burns was not cruel. I want to be clear about that, even though it makes everything more difficult. He was kind to me in his way. He taught me to read, sitting with me at night while Mrs. Burns mended and Katie played. He was patient when I stumbled over words, when I could not make my mouth form the strange sounds of English.

"Try again," he would say. "You're a bright boy. You can learn this."

And I did learn. I learned to read. I learned to write the name they had given me: Mike Burns. The letters looked like tracks of birds in sand, meaningless scratches that somehow meant me. I practiced writing it until my hand cramped. Mike Burns. Mike Burns. Mike Burns. As if writing it enough times would make it true.

At night, in the small room they gave me off the kitchen, I would lie awake and try to remember the Yavapai language of my past. I whispered the words for mother, for father, for the mountain that has been chopped up, for the red earth, for the mesquite harvest. I said them so quietly that even I could barely hear them, afraid someone might be listening.

Sometimes the words came easily. Sometimes they slipped away and I chased them, repeating them until they stayed. Letting them fade frightened me more than anything.

---

Captain Burns took me with him sometimes when he went about his duties at the fort. I would walk beside his horse, carrying his saddlebag, trying to match his stride. The soldiers would look at me. Some of them looked with pity. Some with curiosity. Some with the same look they gave the captured Apache scouts—a look that said I was a thing, not a person. A possession. A pet.

"That's the Yavapai boy Burns took in," I heard one soldier say to another as we passed.

"Poor little devil," the other replied. "Burns gave him a chance at civilized life."

I kept my eyes down and kept walking. I had learned that was best. Keep your eyes down, speak when spoken to, do not cry no matter what you feel.

They traded stories about how I had come to the fort, as if my life were a rumor to pass around after supper. I let their talk drift past me. Holding on to the present was the only way to keep from sliding backward.

Mrs. Burns said it was better to look forward, not back. "You're safe now," she would tell me, smoothing my hair. "You have a family now. You have a future."

I would nod and say, "Yes, ma'am," because that was what she needed to hear.

At night I practiced the same discipline. If memories clawed at the edges of sleep, I pushed them away before morning. In the daylight I wore the uniform, followed the rules, and pretended the past was sealed shut.

---

In the spring of 1874, Captain Burns told me we were going to Ireland.

"To meet my parents," he said. "They'll want to see the fine young man I've taken under my wing."

I did not know what Ireland was. He showed me on a map—a green island across a vast ocean. So far from the land that would become Arizona it might as well have been the moon. I tried to imagine getting on a ship and sailing across all that water to a place where everyone would be white and Irish and I would be even more alone than I already was.

But Captain Burns was excited about it, so I tried to be excited too.

"You'll like it there," he said. "Green hills, soft rain. Nothing like this desert."

The desert. He said it as if it were a barren place, a hard place, a place to escape from. He did not know how the desert blooms after rain, how the saguaros hold water in their flesh, how the shade of a palo verde can save your life in summer. He did not know that the desert was home, that it was beautiful, that it had fed the Yavapai for thousands of years.

But I did not tell him that. I just nodded and said, "Yes, sir. It sounds wonderful."

I was learning to tell people what they wanted to hear. It was another kind of survival.

---

We never went to Ireland.

In June of 1874, Captain Burns rode out with his troop on patrol. I stayed behind with Mrs. Burns and Katie, helping around the quarters, studying my letters. He promised he would return in a week.

He did not return in a week.

Word came that he had died at a place called Navajo Springs. Fever, they said. Or pneumonia. The exact cause did not matter. What mattered was that he was gone.

Mrs. Burns wept. Katie wept. I stood in the parlor in my blue wool uniform and did not know what to feel.

This man who had taken me in, who had given me his name, who had taught me to read, who had promised to take me to Ireland—this man was dead.

Should I grieve for him? Should I feel relieved? Should I feel anything at all?

I felt nothing. Just a hollow place where feelings should be. I had learned too well to keep everything locked inside.

They buried Captain James Burns at Fort Wingate, New Mexico. I did not go to the funeral. I was not family. I was just the Indian boy he had taken in.

Mrs. Burns held my hand. "You'll be all right," she said, though her eyes were red from crying. "We'll make sure you're taken care of."

Two weeks later, I was given to Lieutenant Bishop.

---

Hall S. Bishop was a different kind of man than Captain Burns. Younger, louder, quicker to laugh. He looked at me and said, "So you're the boy Captain Burns was so fond of. Can you ride?"

"Yes, sir," I said.

"Can you shoot?"

I hesitated. I could shoot. I had been taught by—I stopped the thought. "A little, sir."

"We'll improve that," Bishop said. "A man needs to know how to handle a weapon. Even an Indian boy who's learning to be civilized."

He said it without malice, almost cheerfully, as if becoming civilized were a game we were playing together. I would come to understand that Bishop meant well. He treated me like a younger brother or a favorite nephew. He was never deliberately cruel.

But he also never asked me what I wanted. None of them did. They decided what was best for me—what name I should have, what language I should speak, what god I should worship, what future I should want. They decided, and I obeyed, because I was a child and alone and had no other choice.

Bishop took me with him when the Fifth Cavalry transferred east in the summer of 1875. We left the land that would become Arizona—left the red rocks and the saguaros and the mountains whose Yavapai names I was trying not to forget, and traveled to Camp Supply in Indian Territory. Everything was different there. The land was flatter, the sky bigger, the people stranger. I was even more lost than I had been at Fort Whipple.

But I adapted. That was what I was good at. Adapting. Surviving. Becoming whatever I needed to be.

---

The soldiers taught me things they thought were useful. How to care for horses. How to polish leather until it shone. How to stand at attention. How to pray to the white man's god, who apparently cared very much about whether you knelt or stood, whether you said the words right, whether you believed the correct things about a man named Jesus who died on a cross.

I learned it all. I became fluent in their customs, their expectations, their god. I became so good at being Mike Burns that sometimes I almost forgot I had ever been anyone else.

Almost.

But at night, in whatever tent or barracks or temporary quarters I was given, I would lie awake and test myself. The Yavapai words for grandmother, for the river, for home—I repeated them under my breath until exhaustion settled in. If I stumbled, I began again, determined not to let them vanish.

I lived in terror of the day when I would reach for a word and find nothing there, when the Yavapai language would be gone and I would have nothing left to hold.

---

In the summer of 1876, I was eleven years old, and Lieutenant Bishop took me north with the Fifth Cavalry to fight the Sioux.

I had been with the Army for nearly four years by then. I had seen campaigns against the Apache, the Yavapai, the Comanche. I had watched soldiers kill people who looked like me, who spoke languages I half-remembered, who fought to protect their land just as we Yavapai had fought.

And now I would go north and watch soldiers kill the Sioux, and I would carry Lieutenant Bishop's gear and cook his meals and clean his weapons, and I would be the good Indian boy who had learned to be civilized.

We rode through country I had never seen before. Vast plains, endless grass, sky that went on forever. We crossed rivers whose names I could not pronounce. We camped in rain and snow and heat that shimmered on the horizon.

The Sioux were fighting to keep their land. Fighting to stay free. I understood this, though I never said it aloud. I understood it in my bones, in the part of me that was still Yavapai beneath all the English and the uniforms and the American prayers.

At the Slim Buttes fight, I watched soldiers kill a warrior named Yellow Hand. I watched them celebrate the victory. I kept my face blank and my eyes down and my thoughts locked away where no one could see them.

That night, alone, I wept for the first time in years. I wept for Yellow Hand, for the Sioux, for the Yavapai and for every person who had been punished for wanting to stay free.

I wept for the Yavapai boy they expected to forget.

And then I wiped my face and went back to being Mike Burns.

---

They were teaching me to be American. They were teaching me that Yavapai ways were savage and wrong. They were teaching me that the language I spoke as a child was inferior to English, that the god I had prayed to was false, that the land I loved belonged to someone else now.

They were teaching me to forget.

And I was learning.

But I was also learning something they did not intend to teach me. I was learning to watch, to listen, to remember. I was learning to carry two selves inside one body—the self they could see, and the self I kept hidden. I was learning that survival sometimes meant pretending to be what you were not.

I was learning that you could lose everything—your name, your family, your language, your home—and still, somehow, survive.

Whether that survival was worth the cost, I did not yet know.

---

In early 1880, Lieutenant Bishop—now Captain Bishop—sat me down and told me I was going to school.

"Real school," he said. "Back East. A place called Carlisle, in Pennsylvania. They teach Indian children there. Make something of them."

I was fifteen years old. I had been with the Army for seven years. I could read and write English better than many of the soldiers. I could ride, shoot, track, and survive. I had traveled thousands of miles across territories I never asked to see. I had watched Yavapai people hunted and killed and confined to reservations.

And now I was going to school to be "made into something."

What was I before, I wanted to ask, if not already something?

But I did not ask. I just nodded and said, "Yes, sir."

Captain Bishop looked at me with something like affection. "You're a good boy, Mickie," he said. "You're going to do well. You're going to make us proud."

*Us.* The Army. The white men who had taken me in. The people who had erased the life I once belonged to and then raised me as their own.

I would make them proud.

That was what I was for.

---

In September of 1880, Captain Bishop put me on a train heading east. We stood on the platform at Fort Laramie, and he shook my hand like I was a man, not a boy.

"This is your chance," he said. "Your chance to make something of yourself."

I wanted to tell him I had been something already. I had been a Yavapai.

But I could not say any of that. The words were locked too deep, buried under too many years of Mike Burns.

So I just said, "Thank you, sir. I'll do my best."

And I climbed onto the train that would take me away from the only world I knew—the Army world that had replaced the Yavapai world—and carry me to yet another place where I would have to learn to be someone new.

The train pulled away from the platform. Captain Bishop raised his hand in farewell. I watched him grow smaller and smaller until he was just a speck on the horizon, and then he was gone.

I was alone again.

I pressed my forehead against the train window and watched the landscape roll by. Mountains and plains and rivers whose names I did not know. America. This vast, beautiful, terrible country that had swallowed the my people whole.

Somewhere in my chest, in the place I kept locked and silent, I felt something stir. Not quite anger. Not quite grief. Something older and harder and more patient than either.

I did not have a name for it yet. But I would carry it with me to Carlisle, and to Kansas, and to every place I went afterward. I would carry it for the rest of my life.

Someday, I thought, I will tell the truth about what happened. Someday I will write it all down, not in the way they want to hear it, but in the way it really was.

Someday.

But not yet.

First, I had to survive. First, I had to learn everything they wanted to teach me. First, I had to become so fluent in their world that they would not suspect what I carried inside.

The train rattled eastward. I was fifteen years old, going to a school designed to kill the Indian and save the man.

They did not know that every word of English I learned was a tool I would someday use to tell the Yavapai story. They did not know that you could teach someone to speak like you, dress like you, pray like you—and still not own what lived inside their heart.

I would learn to be American. I would learn it perfectly.

And then, someday, I would use everything they taught me to tell them what they did to us.

That was my plan, formed on a train heading east, carried by a boy trying to survive.

I would remember. I would learn. I would survive.

And someday, though it would take forty more years, I would tell.

The train carried me away from everything I had known, into a future I could not imagine.
