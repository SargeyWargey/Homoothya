# 3  |  HIGHLAND

### 1885-1886
### Highland University, Kansas
The train that carried me away from Carlisle rolled across states I had only memorized from schoolroom maps. I watched the names stitched onto the depot signs slide past the windows: Pittsburgh, Columbus, Indianapolis. Each whistle stop smelled different. In Ohio it was lake wind and coal. In Illinois it was damp soil and the sweet scent of fermenting corn. By the time the cars clattered into Kansas the horizon had opened like a book laid flat. The sky stretched so wide that it felt as if an ocean had been turned upside down and nailed above the prairie.

Highland was a hilltop town that rose from the tall grass with a steeple and a handful of brick buildings. The university sat at the crest, its white columns facing fields that rolled toward the Missouri line. A Presbyterian minister met me at the station in Troy with a buggy. He wore a collar and a winter coat frayed at the cuffs. He studied the recommendation letter that Pratt had sealed with the school's crest and nodded as if he could already picture me seated in their chapel choir. The road from Troy to Highland cut through bare orchards and farmsteads where smoke curled steadily from chimneys. The air carried the metallic bite of frost and the faint aroma of wood ash. It reminded me of dawn at Carlisle, except there were no barracks, no bugles, no long lines of boys marching with their hands at their sides. Horses, not bells, set the rhythm here.

The campus itself was small enough that I could cross it in the time it took to recite the Lord's Prayer. There was the main hall with its belfry, a brick dormitory for the young men who came from farming families, a plain wooden building for the women's course, and a chapel that doubled as lecture room. I was assigned to a narrow room beneath the eaves, a bed pushed against one wall and a desk against the other. The window faced west. At dusk the sun poured across the fields in a river of gold and the prairie grasses bent in a single direction like congregants bowing in prayer. For the first time since I had been taken to Bishop's household I slept without a hall monitor listening for whispers in a forbidden tongue.

Classes began the morning after my arrival. The bell atop the hall rang at six. Instead of drill we walked to chapel, the students shuffling in boots still dusted with hay. I recognized only a handful of faces from Carlisle. Most of the seats were filled by sons and daughters of settlers who treated the college as a ladder toward ministry, law, or teaching. They wore wool coats sewn by their mothers and carried books that smelled of linseed oil. The faculty sat behind the pulpit. President Craig, with his gray beard and spectacles, asked me to stand and introduce myself. I said, "My name is Mike Burns. I come from Arizona Territory by way of the Carlisle Indian School." A few heads turned. One girl in the front row watched me as if she expected feathers to spring from my shoulders at any moment. When I sat down the boards creaked under my weight and the bell rope swayed gently overhead.

The curriculum felt like a door opening and slamming in the same motion. Algebra leapt beyond anything Miss Burgess had drilled into us. Rhetoric classes demanded we memorize arguments built on books I had never touched. The professors spoke quickly and picked students the way officers pick scouts, by reputation. I answered in English that Carlisle had polished, but the work moved faster than I could catch. Each night I copied equations twice, only to find other students already far ahead when morning recitations began. Professor Merrill still clapped when I managed a clean speech, calling me proof that Carlisle produced miracles, yet I knew I was clinging to the middle of the class with raw fingertips. Miracles were supposed to save souls, not smooth them down until they matched the grain of a table.

There were freedoms here that Carlisle had never permitted. In the afternoons I worked in the orchard to pay my board, pruning trees and hauling crates of apples to the root cellar. No matron inspected my hands for dirt. No monitor followed me to be sure I spoke nothing but English. I could walk into town without seeking permission, so long as I returned before the lamps were doused. I wandered the crest of the hill and watched storm fronts pile up on the horizon. I listened to the whistle of wind in the sycamores and tried to recall the exact pitch of the breeze that wound through the cottonwoods along the Verde River. Memory arrived in pieces. The smell of damp leaves. The sting of cold water on bare feet. A lullaby hummed in a tongue no one here would recognize. I whispered it under my breath as I sharpened pruning shears and promised myself I would not forget the vowel sounds that once held me together.

For all its quiet, Highland had its own discipline. Each week we recited scripture before supper. Each month a missionary visitor stood at the chapel lectern and spoke of the heathen wilderness beyond Kansas. Their maps ended at the Rockies, as if the world past that mountain spine were a blank washed by sunlight. One missionary asked me to describe Apache raids. I told him I had seen hunger more fearsome than any raid. He smiled politely and returned to his lecture about the obligation to tame the continent. In the dining hall the students debated temperance and the virtues of the new railroads while the winter wind rattled the windows. I spoke when it seemed necessary and listened when it was not. Their quarrels felt small compared to the ones that lived in my bones.

Letters from Carlisle followed me west. Miss Burgess wrote to ask how I fared. She reminded me to read widely and to remember that education was a tool to lift my people. Pratt sent a note congratulating me on advancing beyond his classrooms. His words smelled of pride and ownership in equal measure. He reminded me that I carried the reputation of his great experiment. I folded the letter and placed it beneath the mattress. At night I turned it over in my mind, weighing the ways gratitude could become another chain.

Not all the attention felt patronizing. There was a boy named Thomas who came from a farm outside Atchison. His hands were calloused from harness work, and he spoke with the slow drawl of the river towns. After class he lingered to ask about the desert. I described the mesas and the scent of creosote after rain. He listened without flinching, without asking if I missed the hunt or the warpath. He told me about the flood that had taken part of his father's cornfield the year before. We traded stories about land and loss until the shadows climbed the stairwell. Friendship built on shared labor felt different from the manufactured comradeship of the Carlisle dormitory. It rested on choice, not schedules.

In March the university held an elocution contest. President Craig insisted I participate. The piece assigned to me was a sermon on the triumph of civilization, written by a minister who had never set foot west of the Mississippi. I rewrote the ending in my room, replacing his final paragraphs with sentences about the cost of stripping a child of every sound he once knew. During the contest my voice carried through the chapel rafters, steady and measured. When I delivered the altered conclusion, a hush fell heavy enough to make the dust motes pause in the lamplight. The judges awarded me second place. Afterward, President Craig asked to see my notes. His jaw tightened when he realized what I had done. He reminded me that the university expected loyalty to the message. I stood in the shadow of the pipe organ until he dismissed me with a curt nod.

Spring in Kansas arrived with thunderstorms that shook the window panes. Rain pooled in the ruts leading up the hill and the prairie burst into a green so vivid it hurt my eyes. Between classes I read in the library, tracing the lines of geography texts that reduced the Yavapai to a footnote. I copied the entries into my journal and added what the authors had forgotten: the names of the bands, the rivers we followed, the treaties broken before the ink dried. I began sketching the outline of a history that belonged to us. It was a narrow start, but it was mine, not the superintendent's or the principal's.

Yet the longer I stayed, the more I sensed that Highland waited for me to become a trophy. The trustees spoke about sending me on speaking tours to raise funds for future Indian students. They wanted me to stand in pulpits and prove that their benevolence could polish any savage into a gentleman. They praised my penmanship and the posture Carlisle had drilled into me even as my marks slid toward the middle of the blackboard. They ignored the ache that grew heavier each time news arrived from Arizona Territory. Letters from soldiers I had known at Fort Whipple said that unrest simmered near the reservation. One mentioned that the boys who had marched with me to San Carlos were now men with sons of their own, still waiting for the promise of return. The paper in my hands felt thin as the excuses that had escorted them away.

Money pressed its own arguments. The scholarship from the Indian Bureau covered tuition but not all the costs of board. I could stretch my wages only so far. Each time I counted the coins in my trunk I remembered the families at San Carlos measuring meal rations with the same care. I burned extra lamp oil to study and still landed no higher than the middle column when marks were posted. To remain at Highland would require debts to benefactors who believed they owned my future. To leave would be to abandon the path everyone told me guaranteed safety. I spent nights staring at the ceiling, listening to the rain on the shingles, picturing the steady Army pay Bishop always said would keep a man clothed and fed. I imagined sitting across his desk again while he tapped the ledger and promised that service would keep me housed and useful. I asked which road would honor the promise I had whispered when the train pulled out of Carlisle: I will remember.

The answer arrived in June. A letter bearing Lieutenant Bishop's handwriting waited on my desk after chapel. He had heard from Captain Thompson that the Army needed scouts in the Territory. He wrote that a man with my skills could serve with distinction, perhaps even influence the officers who thought only in commands, and he reminded me that Army wages arrived twice a month, reliable as reveille. He promised to place me near his own post so he could watch over my progress, just as he had when I was a boy. He signed the letter Your obedient servant and underlined the words duty and opportunity. I read it twice, then set it beside Pratt's congratulation. Between them lay the divide I had walked for years: obligation to the men who had fed and clothed me, and obligation to the people whose language still pulsed behind my teeth.

I walked to the ridge above the campus and looked west until my eyes watered. Thunderheads rose over the Kansas plain, their undersides black as coal. Each rumble rolled across the fields and pressed against my ribs. I thought of the boys still at Carlisle, the ones who would follow me if their scores were high enough. I thought of the families at San Carlos, waiting for a voice they could trust. The path toward professors' robes no longer felt like freedom. It felt like another room with windows that did not open.

When commencement week ended I packed my trunk with the same care I had used when I first arrived in Pennsylvania. I folded the Highland uniform and laid it at the bottom. On top I placed the journal pages that held the names and memories I refused to let die. I thanked President Craig for the instruction and told him I would not be returning in the fall. He asked if I understood what I was giving up. I told him I understood better than anyone in that office. Education had been a gift and a weapon. I intended to wield it where it mattered.

The morning I left Highland the sky was the color of pewter. Thomas walked with me to the station. He pressed a small packet of tobacco into my hand and wished me safe travel. We clasped wrists, the grip firm enough to leave marks. The train whistle sounded across the valley. As the cars pulled away I watched the campus shrink until the chapel spire was no taller than my thumb. The prairie opened once more, a sheet of green and gold streaked by rivers. Somewhere beyond that horizon waited the mesas and the dry winds of home. I carried forward the words I had learned, the stories I had safeguarded, and a sharpened resolve. Highland had shown me what the nation's dream for me looked like. I would carry my own dream instead.
