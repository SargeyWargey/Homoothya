# CHANGING THE RECORD

Mike Burns had written in 1913: "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

As the only known firsthand survivor account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his testimony carries unique historical authority. Military records document the attack from the Army's perspective: troop movements, casualty counts, tactical decisions. But Mike's manuscript provides what official records cannot: the experience of being forced to guide soldiers to his family's hiding place, the sound of gunfire echoing in the cave, the sight of soldiers rolling boulders over the edge to crush people trying to escape, the brutality of Pima and Maricopa scouts in the aftermath, the human cost measured not in statistics but in the faces of the dead.

With the publication of Mike's testimony, historians and the public finally had access to the Yavapai perspective on Skeleton Cave.

Military reports had claimed a justified engagement against hostile combatants. The official casualty count varied: some reports said 54 dead, others 76. All downplayed or ignored the presence of women and children.

Mike's account revealed families sheltering in a cave. Women grinding corn. Children huddled in fear. Approximately 80 people were dead by the time the shooting stopped, most of them noncombatants. Soldiers deliberately using ricochet fire off cave walls to multiply the killing. Boulders rolled to crush those trying to flee. Bodies piled at the cave entrance.

The narrative has shifted in historical literature and public understanding. Museums have updated their exhibits. Textbooks have revised their accounts. Historical markers have been changed or removed. The Yavapai perspective, carried by Mike's testimony, has forced a reckoning with the reality of what happened on December 28, 1872.

The language has changed from "battle" to "massacre." The victims are increasingly recognized as Yavapai, not generically as "Apache." The number of dead is acknowledged as far higher than early reports claimed. The presence of women, children, and elders is centered rather than minimized.

This change matters. Language shapes memory. Memory shapes how we understand ourselves and our history. For more than a century, the dominant narrative allowed Americans to see Skeleton Cave, if they saw it at all, as a regrettable but necessary military action. Mike's testimony makes that narrative impossible to sustain.

One witness changed the record.
