# Chapter 13: The Mesquite Harvest

The earliest morning I remember best, I was small enough to climb.

My grandmother's voice rose from below, patient as the sun. "Higher, Hoomothya. The sweetest pods grow where the branches are thin."

I stretched toward the golden clusters, my toes gripping bark worn smooth by summer heat. The mesquite tree swayed, and I swayed with it, the whole world tilting beneath me. Below, burden baskets waited like open mouths. My mother and aunts moved between the trees, their hands quick and sure, filling the baskets with the dry rustle of pods pulled from branches.

"Not too high," my mother called, but she was smiling. I could hear it in her voice.

I reached for a cluster just beyond my fingertips. The pods were fat and golden, darker than the others, and when I pulled them close they smelled sweet enough to make my mouth water. The branch dipped under my weight. For a heartbeat I hung there, suspended between earth and sky, the Salt River shining in the distance like a snake's skin catching light.

Then my fingers closed around the pods and I dropped them down.

"Good," grandmother said as they landed in her basket. "You see? The tree gives what we need."

The sun stood high now, turning the desert white. Heat rose in waves from the canyon floor, but up here in the branches the air moved, carrying the scent of creosote and dust and the river somewhere beyond the rocks. My cousins worked the trees nearby. I could hear Nashta laughing at something, then my aunt's voice hushing her, gentle.

I climbed down slow, the way my uncle had taught me. "Three points touching," he'd said, "always three." Hand, hand, foot. Hand, foot, foot. The bark warm against my palms.

When I dropped to the ground my grandmother was watching me with eyes that saw everything. She reached out and brushed my hair back from my forehead, her fingers dry and light as milkweed silk.

"You're growing," she said. "Soon you'll be too big to climb."

"Then who will get the high pods?"

"Someone smaller." Her mouth curved. "The world keeps turning, child. That's how we know we're alive."

My mother held out the waterskin and I drank. The water tasted like the clay pot it had come from, cool despite the heat. She took it back and drank herself, then poured a little over her hands and wiped her face.

"Your father will be proud," she said. "Look how much we've gathered already."

The baskets were half full, and the sun had barely begun its fall toward the western mountains. All morning we'd worked like this, the rhythm of it steady as breathing. Reach, pull, drop. The pods rattling into baskets. My hands sticky with mesquite sap, my legs scratched from bark, my heart full in a way I had no words for.

Nashta ran up holding a pod that had split open. "Look, grandmother, it's already sweet inside."

Grandmother took it and examined it like it was something precious. "The tree knows," she said. "It opens when it's ready."

We worked until the sun sat lower, painting the canyon walls red and gold. My mother sang while she gathered, a song about the mesquite and how it had saved the people in the hungry time. My aunts joined in, their voices braiding together. I didn't know all the words yet, but I hummed along, the melody familiar as my own heartbeat.

When grandmother said it was time to return to camp, we lifted the burden baskets. Mine was smallest but still heavy, the carrying strap pressing against my forehead. We walked single file along the trail that followed the river, my mother in front, grandmother behind me. The weight made me strong. I could feel it in my legs, in my back, in the way I had to lean forward to balance the load.

Ahead, smoke rose from the cooking fires. I could smell rabbit roasting and my stomach woke up all at once, growling. Nashta giggled behind me.

"Someone's hungry," my aunt said.

"I could eat a whole deer," I said, and everyone laughed.

"First you have to help bring one down," my uncle's voice came from the trail ahead. He stood there with my father, both of them empty-handed but smiling. No deer today, then. But they looked happy anyway, the kind of happiness that came from being out on the land, from moving quiet through the world and seeing what there was to see.

My father reached out and steadied my burden basket when I stumbled on a root.

"Careful," he said. "You carry too much, your legs will remember it tomorrow."

"I'm strong enough."

"I know you are." His hand rested on my shoulder for a moment, warm and heavy. "But even the strong rest."

At camp, we set the baskets down in the shade of the ramada. My back sang with relief. Other families were returning too, their own baskets full. Tonight or tomorrow we would pound the pods into meal, the sound of stone on stone echoing through the canyon. We would press out the sweet juice and drink it, or make it into cakes that would keep when we moved to the higher country.

The thought of moving made me both sad and excited. I loved this place, this camp by the river where the mesquite grew thick and the water ran even in the dry times. But the mountains were different, cool and green, and there would be walnuts to gather and new places to explore.

"Come, Hoomothya." Grandmother was already at the grinding stone. "I'll show you how to pound them fine."

I knelt beside her on the smooth rock. She took a handful of pods and placed them in the shallow bowl worn into the stone by generations of hands. Then she gave me a smaller pounding stone, smooth and heavy.

"Not too hard," she said. "Listen to the sound. It will tell you when it's right."

I brought the stone down. The pods cracked and split. Again. The rhythm of it filled my hands, my arms, the air around us. Grandmother nodded.

"Good. You're learning."

Across the fire, my mother was skinning the rabbit my uncle had brought. Her knife flashed in the fading light. My father sat with the other men, talking in low voices, their hands moving as they spoke. One of them was shaping an arrow shaft, his fingers patient and sure.

Everything was as it should be. The mesquite pods splitting under stone. The fire crackling. The smell of food and smoke and the river. My people around me, their voices rising and falling like a song I'd known before I was born.

I didn't know then that I would remember this day for the rest of my life.

I didn't know that I would reach for it again and again in the years to come, like reaching for those golden pods in the high branches. I didn't know that the sound of my grandmother's voice and the weight of that burden basket and the taste of river water would become the things I carried when everything else was taken.

I was just a boy, pounding mesquite, learning the work of my people.

I was Hoomothya.

And I was home.
