# Chapter 24: Pilgrimage

January cold woke me before the lamp. Frost silvered the corrals at Fort McDowell, and the boards of our porch creaked like brittle reeds when I stepped outside. Chehata had been up longer than I had. She moved like breath in the lamplight, wrapping fry bread in cotton cloth and tucking smoked venison into a saddlebag.

She pressed a jar of juniper salve into my palm. "Keep him warm," she said. The smell of cedar smoke clung to her braids. She tied two wool blankets with rawhide strips, the knots neat and strong, then laid them over the rail beside the bridles. "For the ones you bring home," she added softly.

Carlos stood in the doorway, coat draped over his shoulders, the lines beneath his eyes deeper than they had been in September. The cough he tried to hide shook his entire frame. When it passed he lifted his chin and smiled as if the breath had not sliced him. He wore the scarf Chehata had woven for him years ago, crimson against his pale skin, and he held his doctor's bag with the care of someone carrying a fragile heart.

"We will not be gone long," he told her. His voice still carried the Chicago lecture hall cadence, but it rasped now, thinned by the desert winter. "Only the time it takes to walk the circle."

Chehata touched his cheek the way Grandmother once touched mine. "Walk slow," she said. To me she whispered, "Bring them home, Hoomothya." Her hand lingered against my chest, feeling the quick thud beneath my ribs. I nodded. Words felt too small in that moment, smaller than the task ahead.

Our horses stamped clouds of vapor while I cinched the saddles. I strapped the folded shovels, coils of rope, and the canvas bundles to the pack mare's back, checking each knot twice. In the dim light the cottonwoods along the Verde River rose as dark pillars, their leaves dry from winter. A coyote howled somewhere toward the mesa, a low note stretched thin with hunger.

We rode out before sunrise. The air bit through wool and leather, sharp enough to make Carlos's eyes water. He wiped them with his gloved knuckles and lifted his gaze to the east. The horizon held a bruise-colored glow. Behind us, Chehata stood beneath the porch beam until the darkness swallowed her. I felt the pull of her worry like a rope at my back.

The trail east crossed familiar fields now sleeping under frost. Irrigation ditches glittered with thin ice. Beyond the agency fences the desert opened, a sweep of low grass and cactus spines. Saguaros stood like dark sentries against a sky that slowly lightened from indigo to ash. The cold wind carried the scent of creosote and distant rain, a metallic promise that settled on the tongue.

We camped the first night near a dry wash west of the Mazatzal foothills. Carlos's cough woke him after midnight, rattling through his chest until his whole body shook. I fed juniper needles to the fire and warmed the salve Chehata had packed, pressing it between his shoulder blades while he tried to breathe evenly. "I am fine," he insisted when the spasm eased, though sweat cooled on his brow despite the cold. He lay back on his saddle blanket and asked me to speak of our grandmother until sleep returned. I told him the story of how she once chased rainclouds across the flats, and in the flicker of firelight I saw the boy he had been.

Morning brought thin winter sun and wind that smelled of granite. We rode south of Four Peaks, keeping the Salt River canyon on our right like a wound we were not yet ready to touch. At noon we paused near a stand of mesquite and shared dry tortillas while ravens drifted overhead. Carlos's cheeks had lost some color. He pushed food around with his knife until I stayed quiet long enough for him to eat. "If we turn back now," he said quietly, "everything we promised will stay buried." I knew he was talking about more than bones.

On the second night we sheltered beneath a cluster of boulders that broke the wind. The stars burned so clear that the constellations Carlisle had named returned alongside the older names Grandmother whispered to us. I remembered hunting rabbits with my father in this country, remembered the first time Wassaja and I watched lightning crawl over the cliffs. Those memories rode with me the next day as the desert shifted to chaparral. Carlos's cough deepened, but he rode steady. He kept a handkerchief tucked in his glove and brought it to his lips whenever the rasp grew sharp. Each time I asked if he needed to rest he straightened and said, "Later, when they are safe."

By the third evening we were close enough to hear the river long before we saw the canyon. We slept in a hollow where cottonwoods grew thin and stunted. Carlos woke before dawn and stood facing the east with his shoulders hunched against the cold. "I dreamed of our mothers," he said. "They were waiting on the rim." He wrapped the scarf tighter and mounted without another word. The morning sun found us on a ridge that opened suddenly onto the gorge.

Carlos rode slightly ahead, his shoulders squared despite the cough lurking in his chest. Each time the wind stole his breath he pressed a hand against his ribs and waited for the spasm to ease. "It smells the same," he murmured. "Just like when we were boys. The desert hides nothing." I knew he meant that the land still carried the grief of those it had taken.

As the sun rose, the Dripping Springs quartzite caught the first thin light and threw it back in pale gold. The canyon rim ahead of us glowed, while the depths remained shadowed. Ravens circled above, their calls echoing between cliffs. The river's voice reached us even before we saw it, a steady roar weaving through the wind, growing louder with every mile.

We stopped at the rim where, fifty years earlier, a boy named Hoomothya had pointed toward the cave. The diabase below shone black, streaked with moisture. The river cut silver ribbons through the gorge, its surface churning around hidden boulders. My stomach tightened. Every rock face, every juniper clinging to the ledges, looked exactly as it had on the morning the world ended. I told myself to breathe. I told myself we were not here to betray anyone. We were here to make the ground remember mercy.

I anchored the rope to a stubborn mesquite root and looped it around my waist. Carlos nodded, drawing his own rope tight across his shoulders. His hands trembled, but his eyes were steady. "One step at a time," he said, perhaps to both of us.

The descent demanded silence. We picked our way across the black lava bed that scarred the slope, the stone slick with frozen dew. My boots slid once and sent gravel ticking down toward the river; I leaned into the cliff and waited until the shaking in my legs quieted. Carlos followed close, his breath wheezing in the cold. At a narrow ledge no wider than a boot sole, he faltered. The wind knifed through the gap and tried to pry him loose. I braced myself and caught his elbow. He nodded once, teeth clenched, then moved again. When we lowered the bundles by rope, the muscles in his jaw trembled. I wanted to tell him to rest. He would not have listened.

The cave mouth crouched above us, a dark crescent carved into the cliff. The air shifted the moment we stepped beneath its lip. Outside there had been wind and sun. Inside there was only cold stone and a silence thick as packed earth. The smell hit me first: dust, old smoke, the faint copper tang of long-dried blood. I had not forgotten that smell. My body recoiled before my mind caught up.

We lit tin lanterns and the walls leaped alive with shadows. Bones lay scattered just as the rancher had described years ago, though time had softened the edges. Skulls rested against the back wall like white moons half sunk in dust. Ribs lay collapsed like broken baskets. Among them were things only our people would have left: a cracked clay bowl painted with river lines, a child's bead string, a rusted kettle stolen during flight. I knelt and pressed my hand to the floor. The stone felt colder than ice.

We pulled on buckskin gloves soaked in cedar smoke to keep the old prayers close. I reached for the first skull, surprised by how light it felt, an entire life reduced to the weight of a single breath. Carlos whispered the mourning song Grandmother had taught us before we were taken. His voice scraped raw, yet the words steadied him. Once he rested his hand on my shoulder and said I moved like stone, steady and unshaken, though I felt every tremor inside. I named each person I could as we wrapped them in wool. My aunt. A boy who had carved arrows with me. An elder whose laugh had sounded like falling water. For every bundle I spoke to the dead and told them I did not know which bones I held, that I was guessing with love and memory, that their names would be carried regardless. For the bones I could not name, I offered the names of the mountains and washes that had held us, so no one wept alone.

Hours bent around us without measure. We worked in kneeling silence, passing bundles one to another, binding them tight with rawhide ties. Dust coated our faces and tongues. Each time Carlos lifted a long bone, his hands shook, yet he refused to hand the work to me. I watched him press his forehead to a bundle before setting it aside, a doctor begging forgiveness from patients he had failed to save. My chest burned with a pain that felt older than my lungs.

When we finally counted the bundles, the mare could carry only so many. Long bones still waited in the shadows, laid out like questions. We covered the ones we could not take with wool heavy with cedar smoke and promised to return. Then we stepped back into daylight. Clouds had gathered over the canyon. The sky shifted from pale to slate. Wind whipped out of the north carrying pellets of sleet that stung our cheeks. The ledges we had descended were now slick. We strapped the bundles to the pack mare waiting on the shelf and looped the ropes around our waists again.

Climbing with the dead weight of seventy years pulled on every muscle I had. The sleet turned to a thin curtain of rain that froze the moment it touched the rock. Twice the mare balked and nearly lost her footing. Once Carlos slipped and slammed his shoulder against the stone; he bit back a cry, and I pushed my hip against him until he found purchase. The river's roar rose until it sounded like an accusation. My breath clouded the air in ragged bursts. I whispered apologies to the bundles, promising they would feel warm earth soon.

We reached the rim as the storm broke apart into scattered tatters. The clouds tore open to reveal a strip of blue. We stood there, soaked and shaking, looking down at the place that had made us orphans. Carlos pressed his fist against his mouth. When he lowered it, his eyes shone with tears he refused to wipe away. "It is done," he said. The words trembled, yet they held the weight of a lifetime.

We turned west toward Fort McDowell. The trail wound along the high ground before dropping into the familiar basin. The sun sank low, turning the canyon walls red as coals. The mare trudged behind us, burdened but steady. After several miles I slowed. The urge had been building inside me since dawn, a quiet drumbeat growing louder with every step.

"I want to see where we split," I said. My voice surprised me with how steady it sounded. "If you can bear the detour."

Carlos studied me. His face looked carved from cottonwood root, worn yet unbroken. "We should go," he replied. "We owe the boy we left there." He turned his horse toward the narrow trail that cut across the plateau. I followed, the mare close behind.

The land remembered everything. We passed the twisted juniper that looked like an old man bending over his staff. Its bark peeled in gray strips, the same as the day we left, and a scar from lightning still crossed its trunk. I could see Grandmother's bundle against my shoulder, feel the way it had dug into my collarbone as I walked beside my mother. The memory pressed against my skin until it was hard to breathe.

A little farther on stood the red rocks stacked like a giant's cairn. Sunlight struck them and they glowed as if fire still smoldered inside. I reached out and touched the lowest stone. Sand stuck to my gloved fingers. I whispered a thank you to the ancestors who had marked the trail for us.

Near dusk we reached the spring where we had always stopped to fill waterskins. The seep still whispered along the rock face, tasting faintly of metal the way it always had. We let the horses drink. Carlos scooped water with his palm and held it to his lips. "This carried us north once," he said. "Let it carry you back now."

Beyond the spring the trail curved into the wash where the cottonwood rooted itself. The tree still leaned over the bend, branches splaying wide despite the years. Winter had stripped its leaves, yet the trunk pulsed with life, the bark ridged and scarred from seasons of wind. Wind-blown sand had softened the ring of white pebbles the women had placed, but a few stones still gleamed. The crow feathers Grandmother pressed into the lightning scar had weathered to damp threads. I stood in the shadow of that tree and felt the weight of every year between the boy who hid his bow and the man who had returned to find it.

I dropped to my knees near the roots. The earth there smelled of damp clay and sweet rot, proof that the hidden seep still fed the soil. I pushed my fingers into the ground. It was colder than I expected, almost as if ice lay just beneath the surface. I dug with my hands until the skin split, then used the small spade we had brought for the cave. Carlos stood nearby, breathing slow, guarding the bundles while giving me room to fall apart if I had to.

Soon my knuckles struck stone. I brushed away the dirt and lifted the first grinding stone. Its surface was smooth from decades of women pounding mesquite pod into flour and singing as they worked. My mother's hands had polished that stone. My grandmother's had, too. I laid it gently beside me and unearthed the second, smaller stone that fit perfectly in my palm. I could almost hear the rhythm: stone meeting stone, the beat of our hunger turning into bread. Tears blurred my sight. I blinked them away and kept digging.

Beneath the stones the earth turned looser. My fingers sank into sand. I felt wood, and for a heartbeat I feared it had rotted. When I pulled it free, the unfinished bow lay across my hands like a sleeping animal. One end was smoothed, the other still rough where I had been shaping it with a deer rib. The sinew I had planned to use was long gone, but the stave held the curve I had coaxed from it with a child's patience. The wood smelled faintly of smoke and cottonwood sap even after all these years. A crack ran along the grain where time had dried it too fast.

The sight of that crack split something inside me. I clutched the bow to my chest and bent over it. The world narrowed to the pulse in my ears and the ache in my throat. I saw my mother at the grinding stones, sweat shining on her brow. I saw my father teaching me to bend wood over steam, telling me I would become a hunter worthy of our people. I saw Grandmother's hands burying what we could not carry. Every life cut short fell on me at once: Nashta's bracelets never finished, the songs never sung, the children born into marches they could not survive. This bow had been my promise to grow into the man my people needed. I left it behind. We all left so much behind.

A sound tore out of me before I knew I was making it. I fell forward onto my knees, the bow locked in my arms, and sobs wrenched my body until my ribs ached. The cottonwood branches shuddered in the wind, scattering dry twigs onto my shoulders. The sky above blurred into streaks of color. I could not stop. Each breath broke into another wave of grief. I bowed my head into the dirt and tasted the earth that had hidden our tools, our names, our stories. It tasted of iron and salt and years stolen.

The unfinished bow was the unfinished life of our people. A task interrupted. A hunt that never began. I had spent decades writing and speaking, yet the wood in my arms showed me how much remained undone. It was as if Grandmother had placed a mirror here to remind me of who I was before anyone called me Mickey.

Carlos knelt beside me without a word. His knees sank into the damp sand. He set his hand against the back of my neck and held it there until my sobs slowed enough that I could breathe. Then he pulled off his gloves, cupped my face, and wiped the mud and tears with his thumbs as gently as a mother tending a fevered child.

"Hoomothya," he whispered, and then he said it the way White men tried to spell it. "Holm Theo." He smiled through tears. "Wet Nose. You are still him. You never left."

He kept his hands on my cheeks. "We finish what they began," he said. "We finish it together." His voice shook but his hands remained steady. I leaned into his touch and let the bow rest between us like a fragile heart mended at last.

The wind eased. Dusk settled over the wash, turning the cottonwood branches into black lace against a violet sky. I laid the grinding stones back into the earth, this time placing them beside the trunk without burying them. The bow I wrapped in buckskin and tied to my saddle. When we rode away, the cottonwood's silhouette watched us go, guardian of all we had been. The bundles on the pack mare shifted softly, as if the ancestors inside were breathing easier. I whispered to them that the road home had opened. I whispered to the boy I once was that his bow would find its string. The desert answered with a hush that felt like blessing.
