# CHAPTER 8: INTERLUDE - RETURN TO THE PAGE

## Late 1920s to Early 1930s

The lamp spits once when the match touches the wick, then settles into a thin circle of gold. Outside, Fort McDowell sleeps. Inside, the house holds the hush of a family who has already said goodnight. The blank page in front of me refuses to rest at all.

I am an old man with a pencil, yet the boy who lived in Captain Burns's quarters still sits inside my chest. He is the one who stood behind officers while they made promises. He is the one who carried dispatches, poured coffee, polished boots. He was told to listen and keep still. Tonight I ask him to lend me his memory without his silence.

Chehata hears the lamp before the words arrive. She steps from our room with her shawl around her shoulders and that steady look she has carried since the day she asked whether I understood. She sets a cup of coffee by my hand. "You stopped before the Rio Verde pages," she says. Her voice is gentle but sure.

"I only watched," I tell her. "I was a servant boy in the captain's care. The story belongs to those who walked the roads."

"It belongs to the ones who watched too," she answers. "You saw enough to know what was taken."

I remember the narrow bed near Captain Burns's study, the smell of ink and leather, the way boots crackled on the porch when new orders arrived from Prescott. I remember General Crook speaking in the yard while I stood with a tray, and how the promise he made seemed to settle over every man within earshot. I remember the officers' faces weeks later, drawn tight while they whispered in doorways. I fetched ledgers, sealed envelopes, carried them from desk to desk. The words on those pages were not for me, but I felt their weight in my hands.

I try to place those fragments on the paper without stepping ahead of the chapters to come. The fields along the Verde, the sickness, the march itself will have their full telling soon. Here I write only that I watched through open doors and from shadows near the parade ground. I write that the wagons were counted at dusk, that the quartermaster locked stores and double checked his lists, that Captain Burns told me to stay inside when the scouts saddled their horses. He said it was Army business. I let the curtain fall back into place and saw the column move off through its narrow gap. Snow lingered along the shaded side of the adobe wall. I stayed where I had been told.

Later years handed me the rest. Highland took me far from Arizona, but every journey home brought stories pressed into my palm by men who had marched, by women who buried kin along the trail, by children who grew up in San Carlos and asked why their grandparents spoke of a valley with flowing water. As a scout I rode the country and saw camps charred to stubble, irrigation ditches filled with silt, graves that never bore markers. I know the details now because my people trusted me with them when I returned. They watched me sharpen pencils and said the officers already wrote their version. Mine must answer it.

Chehata rests her hand over mine. "You do not need to chase every mile tonight," she says. "Only tell our grandchildren that you saw the promise loosen before it broke."

So I write the evidence a bystander carries: the creak of wagon wheels crossing the parade ground in the dark, the officers eating in silence, the sudden shortage of candles, the way the fort laundress folded her apron with shaking hands because she already knew whose blankets would be cold. I write that the captain never quite met my eyes after the orders were read aloud in his study. I write that I stood near the doorway and heard enough to understand that the families beyond the fence were no longer welcome to the land they had been told would hold them. I add that when I finally stood with those families again after Highland, their questions and scars matched what I had witnessed in miniature. The bystander became a witness twice over, first to the planning, then to the aftermath.

My handwriting is spare tonight. Each sentence feels like a fence post marking the path the longer story will follow. Carlisle and Highland taught me to arrange facts; survival taught me to listen for what those facts cost. I owe the page both lessons. The officers kept their ledgers in leather. Mine will live under the stone that holds these sheets flat, but it must still be true.

The Army taught me to handle pen and ink. The years since taught me whose story the pen must serve. If I keep quiet, the official reports stand without an answer. If I write, my grandchildren can read the truth of Rio Verde and the march from the mouth of someone who loved the people who endured them. That is the burden and the right I carry tonight.

When the page holds a modest column of lines, I set down the pencil. Chehata reads what I have written and nods. "That is enough to open the door," she says. "Tomorrow you can walk through with the rest."

I cover the lamp and let the room fall back into darkness. In the quiet I tell the boy inside me that he did more than fetch paper. He witnessed. Now the old man will carry that witness forward, one careful step at a time. The next chapter waits, but it no longer waits in the dark.
