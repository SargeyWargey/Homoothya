# Chapter 5: The Cave

I woke to gray light filtering into the cave and voices whispering urgently near the entrance.

For a moment I didn't remember where I was. The stone ceiling above me was wrong, too close and too dark. The air smelled of dust and cold rock instead of sage and juniper smoke. Then it came back—the climb, the cave, the first night sleeping on hard stone with all my people breathing in the darkness around me.

So many of us crowded into this space. Families pressed close together. Children sleeping in tight clusters. Elders near the warmth of banked fires. More people than I could count in the dim light, but I knew we were many. More than the fingers and toes of three or four people. Many more.

My father was already gone from beside me, his sleeping mat empty. My mother was awake too, sitting up with my baby sister—her daughter—in her arms, her face tight as she looked toward the cave mouth where the men had gathered.

"What is it?" I whispered.

"Shh." She didn't look at me. "Stay quiet."

I sat up slowly, careful not to make noise. Other children were awake too, pressed against their mothers, silent and watching. The elders sat near their fires, faces grave.

My uncle came back from the entrance and crouched by our fire. He kept his voice low.

"Soldiers. On the mesa top. Above the canyon. I saw them from the ridge—a small group. And Native scouts with them—Pima or Maricopa, I couldn't tell from this distance."

My father nodded. "How many?"

"Maybe five soldiers. Ten scouts, perhaps a few more. A scouting party."

My father's jaw tightened. "Looking for tracks. For signs of us."

"They're searching." My uncle's jaw tightened. "We stay inside today. No one goes out. No smoke."

My father moved to the next family group, passing the word. Stay inside. Stay quiet. Don't show ourselves.

I looked toward the cave entrance. In the growing daylight I could see more of the canyon—the far wall catching the first sun, the shadows still deep in the canyon bottom. Somewhere up there, on the mesa above us, soldiers were moving. Searching.

Maybe for us. Maybe just sweeping the country.

My mother pulled me close, her arm around my shoulders. Her heart was beating fast. I could feel it through her dress, quick and frightened.

"The cave is hidden from above," she whispered. "They won't see the entrance. We're safe here."

I leaned against her and said nothing. Around us, the cave fell into a careful silence. Fires banked to nothing. Conversations stopped. Even the babies seemed to sense the need for quiet, fussing less, sleeping more.

We waited.

The day passed slowly. Sunlight moved across the cave mouth as the sun tracked across the sky, but we stayed back in the shadows. A few people moved carefully to the entrance to look out, to listen, to see if we could hear anything from above.

Nothing but wind and distant bird calls.

My father stood at the entrance for a long time, watching the sky, the canyon rim, listening.

"Maybe they'll leave tomorrow," my aunt said. But she didn't sound like she believed it.

We ate cold food—dried meat, mescal, mesquite cakes. No fires to cook with, nothing hot. The water in our basket was getting low. Someone would have to go down to the river soon to refill the baskets, but not while soldiers might still be near.

As the sun set and darkness came again, we rolled out our sleeping mats in the same places as the night before. But tonight felt different. Tonight the cave didn't feel like shelter.

It felt like a trap.

I lay between my parents again, staring up at the dark ceiling. Somewhere in the darkness, a child whimpered. Was shushed. Fell silent.

The stone was cold. The darkness was complete. Somewhere out there, soldiers might be making camp for the night, or they might have moved on. We had no way to know.

I pressed against my mother's side and listened to her breathing, steady and slow. My father's breathing too, deep and even. The sound of my people all around me in the darkness.

Tomorrow we would know if the soldiers had gone. Tomorrow we might be able to light fires again, to move freely, to stop holding our breath.

Tomorrow.

I closed my eyes and waited for sleep to come.
