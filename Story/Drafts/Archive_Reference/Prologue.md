# PROLOGUE: The Witness

**Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona**
**May 1934**

The Verde River sounds different at dawn. Softer. Like it's remembering something it doesn't want to say out loud.

I sit at this table, scarred pine that belonged to the Agency office before they gave it to me, and watch the light come silver through the cottonwoods. My hands rest on the wood, fingers thick with age, knuckles swollen from roughly sixty-nine years of holding things I should have let go. The pencil waits beside a stack of paper, white and blank as winter sky.

I've been sitting here since before first light. Watching my hands. Watching the pencil.

There are words that live so deep you can feel them in your bones before your mouth knows how to shape them. Words that wait a lifetime to be said. I've carried these words since I was a boy, since the winter morning when the soldiers came, since I watched everything I knew turn to blood and smoke and silence.

I am the only one living to tell.

That's the truth that brought me here. That's the truth that won't let me rest. Sixty-two years I've lived with it, felt it pressing against my chest when I wake, tasted it in my mouth when I try to sleep. Sixty-two years of carrying names I was never meant to hold. Sixty-two years of knowing I must speak, and no one willing to listen.

But I'm old now. The headaches come more often. My heart stumbles in my chest like a man who's forgotten which way is home. The doctor at Fort Whipple told me what I already knew, that time is short, that the body knows when its work is nearly done.

So I've come here. To Fort McDowell. To this scrap of land the government carved from our homeland and called a gift. Twenty-four thousand acres of what used to be millions. The military post where soldiers once hunted my people, now given back to us like you can wash blood from stone and call it clean.

But it's still Yavapai land. The desert still knows our names. The mesquite still offers its beans come summer, and the saguaro still opens its fruit to the sun. The Verde River runs through this place the way memory runs through me. Constant, wearing everything smooth.

I can finish the story here.

Outside, a cactus wren starts up its morning racket. The sound reminds me of my mother, though I don't know why. Maybe because she used to laugh at the way they scold, like old women who've seen too much foolishness and don't mind saying so. I was seven years old when I last heard her voice. Sometimes I think I've forgotten the sound of it. Then I hear a wren, or the wind in the palo verde, and suddenly I'm small again, and she's near, and the world hasn't broken yet.

I pick up the pencil. The weight of it feels right. Captain Burns taught me to write. Captain James Burns, who captured me when I was seven years old, who took me into his home and gave me his name and his language. Who taught me English when my own tongue was beaten out of my mouth. Who made me into something I was never meant to be.

Without him, I could never tell this story. Without what he did to me, I would have no words for it.

That's the bitter gift. The cruel irony I carry in these swollen hands. I am the only one living to tell, but I am also the only one left with the education to tell it. The only one who survived long enough. The only one who learned their language well enough to turn it back on them.

Carlisle Indian School made sure of that. "Kill the Indian, save the man." That's what Superintendent Pratt said. That's what they tried to do. They cut our hair and dressed us in uniforms and forbade our languages. They tried to bury who we were so deep we'd forget we'd ever been anyone else.

But the dead don't forget. And neither do I.

I learned to write in the language of the soldiers who killed my people. I learned to read in the tongue of the government that tried to erase us. And now I will use their words like a weapon turned back on itself. I will write what they tried to silence. I will tell what they want forgotten.

I am the only one living to tell about what happened to my people.

For twenty-four years I've been writing this story. Twenty-four years of putting words on paper when the weight of them makes my hand shake. Twenty-four years of letters to publishers who won't print it, to historians who don't answer, to a world that doesn't want to hear that their heroes were the ones who slaughtered women and children without mercy.

In 1910, I wrote to Miss Sharlot Hall. She's the territorial historian in Prescott, knows more about Arizona than almost anyone. I asked her, polite as I could, if she could help me tell a little history of my people. Including my own history.

She was kind. She tried to help. But no one wants to publish an Indian's story, especially not one like mine. Especially not one that tells the truth about men the newspapers called brave. About soldiers they named heroes. About a campaign they celebrated as victory.

They want the story they already believe. The one where the Apache were savages and the soldiers were civilized. The one where progress required blood and God blessed the massacre. The one where a little Indian boy should be grateful to be saved from his own people, grateful to be given a white man's name and a white man's god and a white man's place in a white man's world.

I won't write that story.

I'll write the truth. Even if no one reads it. Even if these pages sit in a drawer until they yellow and crumble into dust. The dead deserve witness. The murdered deserve their names spoken aloud. My mother deserves more than silence. My father deserves more than being forgotten. The seventy-six people who died in that cave deserve someone to say: This happened. This was wrong. These were human beings, and they were killed for being alive.

I am the only one living to tell.

So I'll tell it. All of it. The way the desert smelled when I was a boy, before I knew what fear tasted like. The way my mother's hands looked shelling mesquite beans, patient and sure. The way my father's face changed after the soldiers killed her, how the grief turned to something harder, something that couldn't be softened or reasoned with.

I'll tell about being captured. About being frightened and alone and dragged through six days of cold and hunger and not understanding why. About the terrible thing I was forced to do, the weight of it I've carried ever since.

I'll tell about the gunfire. About the screams that stopped too soon. About the silence afterward, thick and terrible, and the way I understood, too young, too small, too late, that everyone I loved was gone.

I'll tell about Captain Burns taking me in, and how I hated him and needed him and couldn't separate the two. How he was kind sometimes, and how that kindness felt like a knife. How I became Mike Burns because there was no other way to survive.

I'll tell about Carlisle, where they cut my hair and dressed me like a soldier and tried to teach me that my people's ways were savage and shameful. Where I learned to read and write, learned skills I'd need to survive, learned to hate and love my education all at once.

I'll tell about being an Army scout. About tracking Apache and Yavapai for the same soldiers who'd killed my family. About how survival sometimes means betraying everything you are, and how you learn to live with that, and how you never really learn to live with that.

I'll tell about registering to vote in 1908. First Indian in Arizona Territory to do it. They made me prove I was "competent." Made me sever my tribal relations on paper, like you can cut connection with a signature. I registered. I voted. I claimed the rights they said Indians couldn't have. But the cost was admitting, in writing, that I wasn't Yavapai anymore. That I was American instead of what I really was.

What I really am.

I look down at my hands again. These hands have held so many things. My mother's hand when I was small. A soldier's rifle when I was a scout. A pencil when I learned to write. These same hands, doing all of it. The same flesh trying to hold two lives that should never have fit in one body.

The light is full now. The cottonwoods shiver in the morning breeze, their leaves bright and new. Summer is coming. I can feel it in the air, that particular heat that rises from the desert floor and shimmers everything into mirage. I've lived roughly sixty-nine summers. This might be my last.

That's all right. I'm not afraid of dying. I've been dead before, in a way. I've been carrying the weight of the dead since I was seven years old, holding their silence, speaking their unspoken words. Maybe death will be a relief. Maybe I'll see them again. My mother, my father, all the ones who never got to grow old, never got to tell their own stories.

But first I have to finish this.

The pencil feels light in my hand. I press it to the paper. The scratch of graphite sounds too loud in the morning quiet, but I don't stop. The words know where they're going. They've been waiting long enough.

*There was a boy once. He had another name, a Yavapai name, before the soldiers came. Before everything changed. Before the world broke open and swallowed everyone he loved.*

*That boy lived in a time when the desert was home and not prison. When his people moved with the seasons, up into the mountains when summer heat made the valleys shimmer, down to the rivers when winter touched the high country with snow.*

*That boy lived in a world that doesn't exist anymore. A world the government tried to erase. A world I'm the only one left to remember.*

The pencil moves steady now. My hand doesn't shake. The words flow like the river outside, carrying everything I've held inside for sixty-two years. The dead are speaking through me. The ones who never got to write their own stories. The ones whose voices were silenced by gunfire and policy and the slow grinding erasure of a government that wanted our land but not our lives.

I write until my fingers cramp. Until the sun climbs high and hot. Until the stack of blank paper beside me grows smaller and the stack of written pages grows tall.

I write what they didn't want written. I tell what they wanted forgotten.

I am the only one living to tell.

And, I'll tell it.
