# Archive Reference - Original Chapter Drafts

## Purpose
This folder contains the original chapter drafts (Prologue + Chapters 1-10) from the previous story structure. These drafts are being preserved for reference but are **not part of the current writing workflow**.

## Context
These chapters were written based on an earlier outline structure before the project shifted to the Chronological_Outline_v2.md structure (dual-identity reveal approach).

## Status
- **Do NOT edit or continue these drafts**
- **DO reference for**:
  - Voice samples and writing style
  - Scene ideas and sensory details
  - Character development approaches
  - Cultural details and research integration

## Current Outline
The definitive outline is now: `/Story/Outlines/Chronological_Outline_v2.md`

New chapters will be written based on this v2 structure, which features:
- Act I: Mike's life as servant (no reveal he was Hoomothya)
- Act II: Mike writing Hoomothya's story in third person (mystery builds)
- Chapter 21: The reveal (Mike WAS Hoomothya)
- Act III: Publication journey and posthumous triumph
