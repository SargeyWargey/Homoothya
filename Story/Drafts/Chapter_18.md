# Chapter 18: Six Days

The soldiers didn't leave.

For three days we knew they were somewhere on the mesa above us. We couldn't see them from the cave, but we knew they were there, searching. We lived in whispers. Moved like shadows. The fires stayed cold.

On the fourth day, scouts reported they had moved.

My father stood at the cave entrance with the other men as word came back from the watchers. The soldiers had ridden north across the mesa top. Gone, finally. Disappeared into the broken country beyond.

"Gone," my uncle said. Relief in his voice. "Finally gone."

But my father didn't relax. "Or they're circling. Coming back from another direction."

"You think they know we're here?"

"I think they're looking. And they're persistent."

Still, with the soldiers out of sight, life in the cave began to loosen. People spoke in normal voices again. Fires were lit for cooking. Children who'd been forced to stay quiet and still for days were finally allowed to move around, to play in the back of the cave where the darkness was deep and their laughter wouldn't carry.

I played with them for a while, a game of hiding and seeking among the rock formations at the cave's rear. But my heart wasn't in it. Every time I heard footsteps approaching the entrance, I froze, listening, waiting for the alarm.

It never came.

That evening the meat ran out.

My mother scraped the bottom of the storage basket, finding only a few dried strips. She made a thin stew with prickly pear pads and what little meat remained, cooking it in a basket by dropping hot stones into the water until it boiled. Everyone got a portion, but it was small. Not enough. My stomach was still hollow after I finished.

"We need to hunt," my uncle said to my father that night. They sat by our fire, voices low. "Tomorrow. While the soldiers are gone. We can't wait any longer."

My father looked at the children, at the elders, at the mothers nursing babies. All of us getting thinner. "It's risky."

"It's riskier to starve."

A long pause. Then my father nodded. "At dusk tomorrow. You take the boy. I'll stay here—someone needs to organize the defense if the soldiers come back while you're gone."

My uncle opened my mouth to protest, but my father cut him off. "You're the better tracker anyway. And Hoomothya is old enough to help carry game. Two hunters, less time exposed. In and out quickly."

My uncle finally nodded, though his face showed he didn't like splitting up. "Dusk, then. We'll go to the mesa above, find deer or rabbits. Be back before full dark."

I fell asleep that night with my stomach growling, dreaming of venison roasting over fire.

***

The fifth day passed in hungry anticipation.

Everyone knew my uncle and I would hunt at dusk. The women prepared to process whatever game we brought back—even in the dark if necessary. The children were quieter, sensing the tension, the need for this hunt to succeed.

I watched my father throughout the day. He organized the men, checking weapons, discussing what to do if soldiers appeared while we were gone. He was staying to protect the family. To protect my mother and sisters.

I watched the sun track across the sky, impatient for evening to come.

As the afternoon shadows lengthened, my father called me over. He looked at me for a long moment. I was young, maybe eight years old, but I'd been on hunts before. I knew how to move quietly. How to read tracks. How to stay downwind.

"You do exactly as your uncle says," he told me. "No noise. No running ahead. If he signals you to freeze, you freeze. Understood?"

"Yes, father."

He pulled me close then, held me in a way he didn't usually do. "Be careful. Come back safe."

"I will."

He touched the top of my head, then let me go.

As the sun touched the western canyon rim, my uncle and I prepared to leave. We each carried a bow and a quiver of arrows. My uncle gave me a small hunting bag to carry whatever small game we might find—rabbits, quail, anything.

My mother pulled me close, her hands on my shoulders. My baby sister squirmed in her arms. Nashta held onto my mother's skirt, looking up at me with wide eyes.

"Be careful," my mother whispered. "Stay with your uncle. Come back safe."

"I will."

She kissed my forehead, then let me go.

My father stood with the other men near the cave entrance, watching us prepare to climb up to the mesa. He raised his hand once, a gesture that might have been goodbye or blessing or warning.

I raised mine back.

Then my uncle and I started climbing.

We climbed up from the cave to the mesa above, moving quietly through the growing dusk. The air was cooling rapidly, that sharp cold that comes to the desert when the sun drops. My breath made small clouds.

Up on the mesa, the land was unfamiliar—I'd only been up here once before, on a hunt with my uncle seasons ago. The juniper and pinyon were dark shapes against the dimming sky. My uncle led us east, away from the canyon rim, toward where he said deer often fed on the brush in the evening.

We moved in silence, communicating only with hand signals. My uncle pointed: fresh tracks in the dust. Multiple deer, heading toward the valley. I nodded and we followed.

The light was fading fast now, that brief time between day and night when the world turns gray and soft. Perfect for hunting. The deer would be feeding, focused on finding food before full darkness came.

We crested a low rise and there they were: five mule deer browsing on mountain mahogany in the valley below. Three does, a yearling, and a young buck.

My uncle and I moved into position. He placed me behind him where I'd be out of the way. He nocked an arrow. Waited for the right moment.

The buck lifted his head, testing the air.

My uncle's bow creaked softly as he drew. The arrow flew.

It took the buck in the chest, just behind the front leg. A good shot. Maybe perfect.

But the deer didn't fall. It wheeled and ran, crashing through the brush, the other deer scattering in all directions.

My uncle made a low sound in his throat. "Hit him solid. He won't go far."

But as we watched, the deer disappeared over a rise, still running strong.

My uncle looked at me in the fading light. "That arrow will kill him within the hour, maybe less. All we have to do is follow the blood trail. We can't let him die and let the coyotes have him. The group needs this meat."

He stood there in the growing darkness, weighing his choice. The need for caution. The equal need for food.

Finally he nodded, more to himself than to me. "We track him. Carefully. We find him, dress him, and head straight back. We won't go far."

We followed the blood trail as darkness fell completely. Dark drops on stone. A smear on brush. The deer was bleeding, but not as heavily as my uncle had hoped. It was still moving.

We tracked for an hour. Then another. The deer kept going, kept moving deeper into the broken country beyond the mesa, farther from the cave.

"He should have fallen by now," my uncle said quietly. His voice held worry.

But he kept tracking. And finally, the buck did fall.

We found him in a small clearing, collapsed on his side, his breathing labored and shallow. My uncle's arrow had gone through the lungs, but hadn't hit the heart. The deer had run farther than any of us expected.

My uncle dispatched him quickly with a knife. We stood in the darkness around the fallen deer, and I felt relief wash through me. We had meat. The group would eat. Father would be proud.

But we'd gone much farther than planned. And it was fully dark now, the moon not yet risen. We'd have to dress the deer here and carry it back in darkness.

My uncle worked quickly, field-dressing the carcass by feel as much as by sight. I held the hunting bag, ready to collect the liver and heart—precious organs we'd eat first.

The work took longer in the dark. Everything took longer. By the time my uncle finished, we were both shivering. The temperature had dropped, that deep cold that comes to the desert on winter nights.

"We need to move," my uncle said, his breath steaming. "Get back to the cave while we can still find the way."

But even as he said it, he was gathering deadwood. "We're too cold. If we try to carry this back now, we'll freeze before we make it. We need to warm up first. Build a small fire, warm ourselves, then go."

He looked into the darkness, toward where the cave lay hidden. Then back at me, shivering. At the deer, cold and heavy. He was weighing the risks.

"A small fire," he said finally. "Just enough to warm us. Then we put it out and go."

My uncle built the fire in a small depression, sheltered by rocks. He used juniper bark for tinder, dry twigs for kindling. The flames caught quickly, small and hungry, growing until we had a fire barely bigger than two hands.

But it was warm. Gloriously warm.

We huddled around it, holding our hands to the heat, feeling life return to our frozen fingers. My uncle kept watch while I warmed myself, then he sat down too, absorbing the precious heat.

"Just a few more minutes," he said. "Then we'll go."

But the cold had settled deep into our bones. A few minutes became longer. The fire felt too good. The warmth was too precious to leave.

I don't remember falling asleep. One moment I was watching the flames dance, the next I was being shaken awake by rough hands.

Not my uncle's hands.

Strangers' hands.

I opened my eyes to see men standing around our fire. But they weren't white men in uniforms.

They were Natives. Like us, but different.

Pima, I realized. Or maybe Maricopa. Enemies. Working with the Army as scouts.

There were four of them, maybe five. They carried rifles—Army rifles. Wore cloth headbands and pieces of Army gear mixed with their own clothing. And behind them, emerging from the darkness, I saw white soldiers. A few of them.

My uncle was already awake, already on his feet. His hand moved toward his knife.

One of the scouts said something sharp in a language I didn't fully understand—some Pima mixed with Spanish. A warning.

My uncle didn't stop.

The gunshot was impossibly loud in the night.

My uncle staggered backward, his hand going to his chest. Dark blood welled between his fingers, black in the firelight.

"No!" I scrambled to my feet but hands grabbed me. Native hands. One of the scouts held me back while my uncle fell to his knees.

My uncle's eyes found mine across the firelight. Wide. Surprised. Already fading.

He tried to speak. Blood bubbled at his lips. Then he went still.

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Couldn't do anything but stare at my uncle lying dead on the ground, the firelight flickering across his open eyes.

The scout who held me said something to the others. They laughed. One of them kicked my uncle's body to make sure he was dead.

Then a white officer stepped into the firelight. Tall, with markings on his shoulders that meant he commanded. He looked down at my uncle's body, then at me. Studied me. Made a decision.

He said something to one of the scouts in English. The scout turned to me and spoke in broken Yavapai, words I could barely understand.

"Where. Your. People."

I shook my head. I didn't understand. Or maybe I understood too well and didn't want to answer.

The scout grabbed my arm, squeezed hard enough to hurt. Asked again. "Where. Your. People. Hide."

He pointed at the darkness around us, made a sweeping gesture. Made a gesture like people hiding in a cave.

They knew we were hiding somewhere nearby. The fire had drawn them. Now they wanted me to tell them where the others were.

Where my father was. My mother. My sisters. Everyone.

I looked at my uncle's body. At the soldiers surrounding us—five, maybe six of them—with their rifles and their Native scouts who'd killed one of their own people.

I was eight years old. I didn't understand politics or war or the weight of the choice I was making.

But I understood this: if I didn't tell them, they might kill me too. Just like they'd killed my uncle.

The scout holding me drew a knife. Put it against my throat. Asked again. "Where."

I felt the blade. Cold. Sharp.

The officer said something in English. The scout with the knife answered. They were arguing about something. About me.

Finally the officer made a gesture and the knife came away from my throat.

But the scout still held me. Still waited for an answer.

"Cave," I whispered in Yavapai. My voice so small I could barely hear it myself. Then, not knowing if they understood, I pointed. Toward where the canyon lay in the darkness. Toward where my father and mother and sisters slept, unaware.

Toward everyone I loved.

The scout smiled. Spoke to the officer in English. The officer nodded.

I'd saved my own life.

But I might have doomed everyone else.

I didn't know yet. Couldn't know. Maybe the soldiers would just look. Maybe they wouldn't find the cave. Maybe my family could escape before they got there.

Maybe. I had to believe maybe.

I was eight years old. And hope was all I had left.

The officer gestured to one of his men. A soldier stepped forward and tied my hands. Not roughly, but firmly. They sat me down away from the fire, away from my uncle's body.

The scouts and soldiers gathered around their officer, talking in low voices, making plans. Every few minutes one would look toward the darkness where I'd pointed, toward where the cave lay hidden.

They knew now. They knew where to look for my people.

And it was my fault.

I sat in the cold darkness with my hands tied, my heart broken, understanding finally what I'd done.

My father was in that cave. My mother. My sisters. Grandmother. Everyone.

And I'd told the soldiers where to find them.

I looked at my uncle's body lying near the fire. He'd died rather than tell them. He'd stayed silent even when they drew their weapons.

I'd told them everything.

I was a traitor. A coward.

And everyone I loved could die because of it.

Maybe they wouldn't. Maybe they'd run. Maybe they'd hide deeper in the cave. Maybe the soldiers wouldn't be able to reach them.

Maybe.

But probably not.

And I would carry this weight forever, no matter what happened.

December 27, 1872.

The night the world began to end.

**[End Chapter 6]**

*Word count: ~2,850*
*Scene location: Mesa above Salt River Canyon*
*Approximate timeframe: December 27, 1872, one day before the massacre*
*Age: Hoomothya approximately 8-10 years old*

**Historical notes:**
- Mike Burns's own testimony states that "Army scouts—derisively called 'Tonto Apaches'—captured the terrified 8-10 year old boy and forced him to reveal his family's location"
- The scouts were likely Pima (Akimel O'odham) and Maricopa auxiliaries working for the U.S. Army
- Mike's father died IN the massacre at Skeleton Cave, not during the capture
- Mike's uncle was killed near the time of Mike's capture (author's interpretation based on Mike carrying guilt about multiple family deaths)
- The exact circumstances of Mike's capture are not fully documented in primary sources beyond the fact that Native scouts captured him and forced him to reveal the cave location
- This version dramatizes a plausible scenario: a desperate hunting trip with his uncle while his father stayed to defend the cave, the fatal decision to build a fire, and a child's impossible choice under threat of death
- The psychological burden of revealing the cave's location under duress would have been crushing for a child—especially knowing his father died there without ever knowing why Mike didn't return
