### Early December 1872
### Superstition Mountains, Salt River Canyon
My father came back on the fifth day.

He looked exhausted. Dust covered him from head to foot, and there were dark circles under his eyes like he hadn't slept. But it was his face that scared me. The hardness in it. The way his mouth was a thin line.

The men gathered immediately. The women pulled the children close but didn't send us away. We needed to hear this.

"There are soldiers," my father said. "Many of them. Camped three days' walk from here, maybe less on horseback. I counted more than a hundred soldiers. Maybe one hundred twenty. And they have Native scouts with them, many scouts. Pima. Maricopa. Maybe some Apache. As many scouts as soldiers, maybe more. They're organizing for something. Preparing."

"For what?" someone asked, though we all knew.

"For us."

"Our own people," my uncle said bitterly. "Pima and Maricopa, working for the Army against us."

"Old enemies," an elder said quietly. "The soldiers use our conflicts against us. Promise them payment, food, and weapons. Turn tribe against tribe."

My father nodded. "I saw them training together. The soldiers and the scouts. They're preparing to sweep the territory. Looking for every band, every camp."

My mother's hand tightened on my shoulder.

"We haven't raided," my uncle said.

"Doesn't matter. Some band did, somewhere. Or they say some band did. To them, we're all the same. All hostile. All Apache."

"We're not Apache," someone said angrily.

"They don't care about the difference."

The silence that followed felt like the air before lightning strikes. Heavy. Electric.

Finally, one of the elders spoke. "What do you think they'll do?"

My father looked around at all of us. At the wickiups and the grinding stones and the children sitting close to their mothers. At the life we'd built here in this canyon.

"I think they'll come looking. I think they'll sweep through the territory, checking every canyon, every water source, every place we might camp. And when they find us..." He stopped. "We can't be here when they come."

"Where do we go?"

A scatter of voices answered all at once. One of the women pointed north, toward the spine of red stone that cut the horizon. "The canyons," she said. "We follow the washes. Hide in the slots and clefts until the soldiers pass."

Old Pine, whose limp stiffened when the cold came, shook his head. "North is open ground before you reach those canyons. They'll see you from a day's ride. We go south. The cave waits."

Wassaja's father stepped into the ring of firelight, his eyes catching the glow. "I know the northern canyons," he said. "I was raised in them. My family will go that way. We can move fast, climb where horses can't, sleep in the hanging gardens above the washes."

My uncle faced him. "And if the snow comes early? If the water dries up? We'd starve in those slots."

"We starve slower than we die in a cave with no air," someone muttered.

Voices crashed over one another, sharp as flint. Mothers drew children close. Young men gripped their bows and looked from face to face, waiting for a decision that felt like choosing which way to die.

My father lifted both hands. The quarrel thinned to a tense quiet. "We split," he said. "Those who know the northern canyons go with Wassaja's family. Travel light, leave no smoke, no trail. The rest come south with me. We take the cave, bar the path, hold as long as we must."

The words settled like dust after a storm. No one liked it, but no one argued.

Everyone knew which cave he meant. The one in Salt River Canyon, high on the north wall. Difficult to reach, easy to defend. A place we'd used before when danger came.

"It's defensible," my uncle said, nodding slowly. "They can't approach without us seeing them. Can't bring horses down that climb. If we have enough food and water, we can wait them out."

"Or they'll trap us there," an aunt said quietly.

"Better than being caught in the open."

Even with the decision made, the adults argued in tight, anxious knots, rehearsing every risk. But the paths were chosen now: one north into the twisting stone, one south toward the cave.

I looked at Nashta. Her eyes were wide, scared. I reached over and took her hand again, the way she'd taken mine that first night when we listened to the adults talking about running.

My mother knelt beside me. "It's going to be all right," she said.

I wanted to believe her. Wanted to feel safe in the certainty of her voice. But I'd seen my father's face. I'd heard what he wasn't saying.

Nothing was going to be all right.

We started packing before dawn.

The wickiup came down fast, the poles and brush that had been our home for three moons reduced to bare earth in less than an hour. My mother moved through the space where our sleeping area had been, her hands quick and sure, gathering what we'd take and leaving what we couldn't carry.

"Only what you can hold," she told me. "Your blanket. Your second pair of sandals. The small waterskin."

I reached for the bow my father had been making for me. The wood was still pale, the grip unfinished, but it fit my hand. "I can take it," I said. "It's light. I'll carry it myself."

My father crossed the space in three steps and took the bow from me. "No," he said. "The wood hasn't cured. It will warp in the cold. Another thing to slow you when we need to run."

"I won't let it slow me."

He shook his head, eyes hard. "Leave it, Hoomothya. We only carry what keeps us alive. When we come back, I'll finish it."

"When will we come back?"

He set the bow against the wickiup frame and didn't answer.

Around us, the whole camp was dissolving. Burden baskets appeared, quickly filled, yet every path through the clearing bent toward the lone cottonwood that anchored our lives here. The tree leaned over the bend of the dry wash, its roots sunk deep into a hidden seep that smelled of damp clay and river moss. In summer, it was the only shade wide enough for all of us; tonight it became the place we bury what we could not carry.

The women brought the grinding stones, worn smooth by generations of meal and songs, and set them in the cool hollow between the cottonwood's roots. My mother then covered them with sage, crushed broomweed, and earth. Grandmother whispered the names of the women who had used those stones before us as she sifted fine sand over them, her hands moving slow and sure. When the pit was filled, they arranged a ring of white river pebbles around the trunk, pressed a fan of crow feathers into the scar left by lightning, and brushed the surface with bundled yucca until it looked untouched. No one spoke. Even the youngest children watched, wide-eyed, as if they understood we were setting part of ourselves into the ground.

When the women moved away, I slipped the unfinished bow from beneath the wickiup poles and knelt beside the cottonwood. I laid it parallel to the buried stones, tucked beneath the spread of roots where the earth still felt cool and damp, and covered it with sand until only leaves showed. My fingers hovered over the spot a moment longer, promising the wood I would come back for it, before I brushed the ground clean.

Beyond the cottonwood, Wassaja's family trimmed their loads to almost nothing, just water gourds, dried meat, a single blanket. His father tested the edge of his obsidian knife, planning the northern canyons. Nearby, my father stacked heavier bundles: rawhide ropes for the cave climb, extra hides to block its mouth, the tools we'd need if the stay stretched longer than hope. Two trails were already forming, though we still camped in the same dust.

When we returned. Everyone said it like it was certain. Like this was just another migration, another move from one camp to another following the seasons.

But I knew it wasn't. This felt different. Felt permanent in a way that made my chest ache.

Grandmother was wrapping dried meat, packing it carefully in layers with juniper leaves to keep it fresh. She worked steadily, her hands never stopping, but her face was distant. Remembering, maybe. Or praying.

"Can I help?" I asked.

She looked up. "Take this." She handed me a small bundle wrapped in hide. "Carry it carefully. It's precious."

I took it. Light, but something hard inside. "What is it?"

"Seeds. Mesquite, agave, squawberry. If we have to plant new, somewhere else, we'll have them."

Somewhere else. The words hung in the air between us.

"Grandmother, are we coming back?"

She stopped working. For a long moment, she just looked at me, and I saw something in her face I'd never seen before. Uncertainty. Fear.

Then she reached out and touched my cheek. "I don't know, child. I don't know."

That scared me more than anything else. More than the talk of soldiers. More than my father's hard face. Because grandmother always knew. She knew when rain was coming. Knew which plants would bear heavy. Knew the stories and the songs and the way things should be.

If she didn't know, we were truly lost.

By the time the sun cleared the eastern peaks, we were ready to go. Over seventy of us would follow my father toward the cave. A dozen more gathered in a tight knot near the cottonwood, Wassaja's family among them, waiting for the moment to slip toward the northern canyons. Everything we owned was on our backs. Everything we couldn't carry lay hidden in the dust.

My father stood at the front, his bow across his shoulders, his face set toward the south. Beyond the ridgeline, the Salt River Canyon carved a dark seam through the land, and somewhere in that seam the cave waited, tight, cold, maybe safe.

"We move fast," he said. "We rest when we must, but we don't stop for long. Stay together. Stay quiet. If I signal, everyone drops and hides. Understood?"

We understood.

My mother adjusted the burden basket on her back, the tumpline across her forehead. Nashta would walk beside her, holding the edge of her skirt. I would walk with the other boys my age, old enough to keep pace, young enough that we didn't carry as much.

My uncle came to stand beside my father. Together they looked south, toward the canyon that would be our refuge. Or our grave.

"Ready?" my father asked.

My uncle nodded.

I caught Wassaja before the groups split. I untied the tiny moon-pale shell bead from my wrist, the shell my first mother had given me, its ridged face polished smooth by years against my pulse, the rawhide cord my second mother had braided so it would stay close. I pressed it into his palm. "For remembering," I whispered. He closed his fingers around it, gave a sharp nod, and slipped back to the line bound north, his dark braid bouncing against his back.

We started walking. Our line dropped over the southern lip of the ridge, feet silent on the sand. Behind us, I watched the northern group peel away, single file, their footprints swallowed by the cottonwood's shade before the wind could erase them.

The clearing emptied in breaths. The wickiup frames lay stacked like broken ribs. The fire pit is cold. The ring of pebbles around the cottonwood caught the first hard light, but the soil above the grinding stones already looked untouched. Everything we'd built, everything we'd been, reduced to marks the next rain would blur.

I looked back once. Only once. Then I turned and followed my father south, toward the canyon, toward the cave, toward whatever was waiting for us there.
