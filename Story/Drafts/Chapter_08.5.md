### 1905
### Washington, DC
The hearing room was smaller than I expected but more intimidating. Congressmen sat in raised chairs behind a long desk. Their faces were stern, skeptical. I recognized the expression. It was the same one agency superintendents wore when they looked at Indians.

Carlos testified first. He spoke with a precision that made me understand why he was respected in Chicago. He cited laws and precedents. He explained how the Kent Decree had violated the *Winters* decision. He detailed the government's pattern of denying infrastructure funding while blaming Fort McDowell for failing to thrive.

"You have systematically starved this reservation," he said, his voice rising with controlled anger. "Not with bullets this time, but with broken promises and bureaucratic neglect. And now you want to claim the land is better used for Phoenix's growth? This is theft dressed in administrative language."

Some congressmen shifted uncomfortably. Others made notes.

Then George testified. He spoke in careful English about walking the trail to San Carlos as a young man, about burying relatives along the way, about returning decades later to find settlers on Yavapai land.

"Fort McDowell is all we have left," he said. "You gave us Roosevelt's promise that we could stay. Now you want to break another promise? How many times will you move us before you're satisfied we've disappeared?"

When my turn came, my mouth was dry. I had written testimony on the train, rehearsed it in the hotel. But sitting in that room, facing those powerful men who held our future in their hands, the words felt inadequate.

I spoke anyway.

"My name is Mike Burns. I was born among the Yavapai. I was present when General Crook promised the Yavapai they could live at Rio Verde as long as they lived. Two years later, they were marched to San Carlos in winter. I was there for that march too."

I paused, letting the weight of those facts settle.

"I learned to read and write in your schools. I served as a scout in your Army. I did everything I was told would make me civilized. And now I am telling you: Fort McDowell is our home. We have rebuilt our lives there. We have planted crops and raised families and relearned how to be Yavapai after decades of being told we should disappear."

My voice steadied as I continued.

"You want the Verde River water for Phoenix. I understand that. Cities need water. But so do people. We are not asking for much. Just the small piece of land President Roosevelt set aside. Just enough water to sustain our fields. Just the chance to live where our ancestors lived before any of this happened."

I met the eyes of the committee chairman.

"If you move us to Salt River Reservation, some will go because they have no choice. But others will refuse. They will die on Fort McDowell land rather than walk another trail of tears. Is that what you want? More Yavapai graves to justify taking what remains?"

Silence filled the room. The chairman cleared his throat.

"Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Burns. We will take your concerns under advisement."

It wasn't a promise. But it wasn't a dismissal either.



Back at Fort McDowell, I reported everything to the community. The hearing, the congressmen's reactions, Carlos's fierce advocacy. People listened with a mixture of hope and caution. They had heard government promises before.

I read from the notes I'd drafted for the hearing, the phrases I'd rehearsed beside the cook fire until the syllables sat steady on my tongue. Speaking them again, with neighbors gathered close, I could feel how words carried weight when people bore witness. Afterward I copied those notes into my ledger, adding the questions the congressmen had asked and the answers I wished I'd given. I wanted a record of the language that made men in suits pause.

"What do you think will happen?" Chehata asked later, when the crowd had dispersed.

"I don't know." I stared at the Verde River, watching the current push steadily toward the Salt. "But I think they heard us. Maybe that's enough to make them pause."

"And if they don't pause?"

"Then we keep fighting."

She leaned against me, and we stood together watching the water that had been the heart of this conflict. It flowed regardless of laws and hearings and broken promises. It had flowed before the Spanish came, before the Americans came, before any of this became necessary. It would flow after all of us were gone.

But while we lived, we would fight to stay beside it.



The answer came in early 1904, not with fanfare but with quiet bureaucratic retreat. The superintendent stopped visiting. The relocation maps disappeared from agency meetings. Rumors reached us through traders: Carlos's congressional testimony had embarrassed the Indian Bureau. The newspapers had picked up the story. Phoenix water interests were still circling, but the immediate threat had passed.

We had won. Not permanently, but for now.

News of the decision traveled the same paths as our letters. Traders repeated the newspaper headlines that echoed Carlos's testimony and my own. Families who had doubted whether words could matter listened as I translated the articles into Yavapai, the ink from far-off presses confirming what our voices had forced. For the first time I believed that spoken promises and written testimony could shake the walls built against us.

At the community gathering to celebrate, George Dickens raised his cup of coffee in a toast. "To Carlos Montezuma, fighting for us in Washington. And to Mike Burns, fighting for us here."

I felt embarrassed by the recognition, but Chehata squeezed my hand. "Let them thank you," she whispered.

Carlos's next letter arrived shortly after. It was brief, written in the tight script of a busy man with little time.

*We stopped them, cousin. But stay vigilant. Phoenix's thirst won't diminish, and the government has a long memory. Document everything. Keep the community united. They will try again.*

*For now, celebrate. You earned it.*

*I am proud to fight beside you.*

At the bottom, he had added a postscript:

*Now write your story. Our people need the truth told. You have a voice. Use it.*

I folded the letter and placed it in my ledger with all the others. The ledger had grown thick with petitions, testimonies, correspondence. It was a history of resistance written one page at a time.
Each page reminded me that ink could do what bullets had failed to do: keep us rooted.

Chehata saw me staring at it. "What are you thinking?"

"That Carlos is right. Someone needs to tell this story. All of it. Not just the victory, but everything that led to it. The broken promises. The march. The canyon."

I paused, feeling the weight of that last word.

"The canyon," I said again, quieter.

"Can you write about that?"

I didn't know. The memories lived behind a wall I had built deliberately. To write them down meant tearing that wall apart stone by stone.

"Maybe not yet," I admitted. "But someday."

She nodded, understanding what I couldn't say. "When you're ready, you'll know. And when you write it, I'll make sure the children listen. They need to understand what their father fought for. What all of us fought for."

In the days that followed, I did what Carlos urged. Each evening after chores I carried the ledger from fire to fire, asking elders to lend me their memories. I wrote as they spoke, stopping often to read the sentences back, wanting to be sure English carried the truth they trusted me with. When my hand cramped, I remembered the committee room in Phoenix and how the right phrasing had cut through polished indifference. These new pages felt like the same fight, only now the battlefield was paper.

Sometimes, after the children slept, I read the freshest lines aloud to Chehata. Speaking them let me test their strength; hearing them reminded me that our story deserved more than whispers. With every retelling my voice steadied. The ledger that once held petitions began to fill with testimony. When the binding grew too tight, I wrapped the loose sheets in oilcloth and tucked them beside our bed. They were not finished, but they were beginning.

Outside, the Verde River continued its patient journey toward the confluence with the Salt. Families moved through their evening routines, cooking dinner, tending animals, gathering children for bed. The normalcy of it felt precious and fragile.

We had kept the land. For now, that was enough.

But Carlos's warning echoed in my mind. They will try again.

And when they did, we would be ready with shovels for the ditches, with voices for the hearings, and with pages of truth no one could ignore.
