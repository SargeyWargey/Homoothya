# Author's Note

This story was born from my years in Arizona, and yes, from a relationship that pulled me deeper into the landscape. Weekends and evenings I'd find myself hiking through the Bradshaw Mountains and across mesas, looking for the traces people left behind: petroglyphs carved into stone, rocks stacked to mark old paths and dwellings. Standing in front of these quiet remnants, I kept thinking about the hands that made them, the lives that moved through these same places. That curiosity drove me to read their stories, to research and try to understand who they were.

During that research, I came across the manuscript of a Native American man named Mike Burns. His story immediately grabbed hold of me. I read everything I could about this man and the Yavapai people, and I came away with a conviction: this is a story that deserves to be told to a wider audience.

I originally started working on this project in 2019 as an idea for a YouTube series, visiting these places, writing out scenes, and telling their stories. Over the years, it evolved into something more: this book. It's something I've worked on, on and off, for five years. What you're reading now is the first draft of that journey.

## Historical Fiction

I want to make it clear that this is a **historical fiction novel**. I conducted research and put tremendous effort into keeping this story weighted toward the historical side rather than the fictional. However, I didn't want this to read like a manuscript or a history textbook. I wanted it to read as the story of one man's life, with narrative flow and emotional impact, while doing my best to honor his experience.

That said, nearly all the characters you'll meet are real people. Nearly all the events that take place are documented historical events. Where the historical record had gaps, I did my best to fill them in to create a cohesive narrative. There is a chapter at the end (donâ€™t go read it yet!) where I explain the specific liberties I took for the sake of storytelling, what is documented historical record, and what I added to bridge the gaps.

## An Invitation for Honest Feedback

I also want to encourage you to be honest with your thoughts about this book:

- Are there places where the story drags or becomes unclear?
- Are there characters you wish you felt more emotionally connected to?
- Is anything confusing?
- Any grammar, spelling, or technical issues you notice?
- Any continuity issues? - Mike moves around a lot and keeping where he was located was a challenge.

After living with this draft for so long, I need fresh eyes. Tell me where the pacing lags, where details obscure the story or where more are needed, where emotional beats don't land.

This is the very first draft that anyone has read. There's quite a bit that will likely change from here on out. The reason I'm sharing it with you now is precisely because I want your honest opinion while the story is still malleable. Don't feel awkward or hold back out of politeness. I want the truth. That's how this book will become what it needs to be.

Thank you for reading Mike Burns's story. And thank you for helping me tell it well.
