# Chapter 9: The Approach

We circled wide around the canyon, staying hidden in the broken country to the south. The morning sun climbed higher but we stayed in shadow, moving through draws and behind ridges where we couldn't be seen from above.

I knew what they were doing. They were positioning themselves. Getting into place for...something. An attack. A siege. A demand for surrender.

Whatever it was, my people in the cave didn't know it was coming.

The column stopped in a deep arroyo maybe a mile from the canyon. Captain Burns dismounted and called his officers together. They spread out a map on a flat rock and talked in low voices, pointing at the paper, then at the canyon in the distance.

I sat on the horse, still tied to the saddle, and strained to hear what they were saying.

"...approach from below..."

"...too exposed..."

"...dawn attack, before they're fully awake..."

Dawn attack. Tomorrow dawn.

My heart sank. They weren't going to attack today. They were going to wait. Get into position tonight, attack at first light when people were still sleeping.

When my family was still sleeping.

One of the officers noticed me listening and said something to Burns. The captain looked up at me, then gestured. A soldier came and led my horse farther away from the officers' meeting, too far to hear anything else.

I wanted to scream at them. Wanted to tell them there were children in that cave. Babies. Old people. Families just trying to survive.

But they knew that. They didn't care. Or maybe they did care and it didn't matter. War didn't care about children or families.

War just killed.

The officers finished their meeting and spread out, giving orders to their men. The soldiers began settling in to wait. No fires. No loud talk. Just quiet preparation for tomorrow's attack.

They untied me from the saddle and let me down from the horse. My legs almost gave out when my feet hit the ground. I'd been riding for hours.

Hayes brought me water and sat with me while I drank.

"This'll be over soon," he said quietly. More to himself than to me. "Then we can all go home."

I looked at him. He had kind eyes, but he was still a soldier. Still part of this. His home was in Ohio, he'd said. He had a son my age who was probably playing in snow right now.

My home was in that cave. And tomorrow these men were going to destroy it.

***

The afternoon dragged. The sun moved across the sky so slowly I thought it might stop altogether. The soldiers rested, checked weapons, talked quietly among themselves.

I sat with my back against a rock and watched them. Tried to memorize faces. Wondered if any of them felt guilty about what they were going to do.

Some looked grim. Others joked quietly, trying to ease the tension. A few avoided looking in my direction, as if I reminded them of something they didn't want to think about.

Burns spent the afternoon with his brass tube, watching the canyon from different angles. He was methodical, careful, making notes in his book. Planning every detail.

As the sun started to set, he came over to where I sat.

"You're Yavapai," he said. In English, so I barely understood. But I knew what the word meant. Yavapai. My people.

I nodded.

"Your family is in that cave."

It wasn't a question. He knew. Maybe he'd known all along. Maybe that's why he'd kept me—insurance, he'd said that first day.

I nodded again.

He crouched down so he was at my eye level. His face was tired, lined with wrinkles I hadn't noticed before. He looked old suddenly. Worn out.

"I'm sorry," he said.

I didn't understand all the words, but I understood the tone. Sorry. He was sorry.

But he was going to do it anyway.

He stood and walked away, and I hated him. Hated all of them. Hated their sorry and their kind eyes and their gentle hands that still held me prisoner while they prepared to kill my family.

***

As darkness fell, the soldiers began to move.

Not all of them. Just a few, moving out in small groups, heading toward the canyon. Scouts, probably. Getting into position. Watching the cave to make sure no one left or arrived.

Burns and the main group stayed in the arroyo. Waiting for the right time.

They tied me to a juniper tree. Not cruelly, but firmly enough that I couldn't slip free. Then they settled in around me, quiet in the darkness.

I could see stars through the juniper branches. The same stars shining down on the cave where my family slept. Did they know I was out here? Were they looking for me? Or had they given me up for dead?

Hours passed. The moon rose, just a sliver, giving barely any light. Perfect for a surprise attack.

Perfect for murder.

A soldier came back from the canyon. He reported to Burns in a whisper I couldn't hear. Burns nodded, made a note, sent the soldier back out.

This happened several times through the night. Soldiers coming and going, bringing information. The people in the cave were settled for the night. Fires were burning down. Sentries were posted but were getting drowsy.

Everything was ready.

I pulled against the ropes, but they held. I tried to scream, but a soldier saw what I was doing and stuffed a cloth in my mouth, gagging me.

"Can't have you warning them," he said. Not unkind, just practical. Just doing his job.

I couldn't even scream.

***

They woke me sometime in the deepest part of night. I'd fallen asleep despite everything, exhaustion overcoming fear.

"Time to move," a soldier said.

They untied me from the tree but kept my hands bound. The gag stayed in my mouth. Two soldiers stayed close on either side, ready to grab me if I tried anything.

The column formed up silently. Twenty men, moving like ghosts in the darkness. I was in the middle, surrounded, no chance of escape.

We started toward the canyon.

The walk took maybe half an hour. Slow, careful, avoiding anything that might make noise. No one spoke. The only sounds were boots on stone, the creak of leather, the soft breathing of men preparing for battle.

As we got closer, I started recognizing landmarks even in the darkness. That rock formation. That juniper tree. The shape of the canyon rim against the stars.

We were close now. So close.

My heart hammered in my chest. The gag made it hard to breathe. I tried to breathe through my nose but it wasn't enough. I was starting to panic.

A hand gripped my shoulder. Hayes. He leaned close and whispered, "Breathe slow. In and out. You're all right."

But I wasn't all right. Nothing was all right.

We reached the canyon rim and started down. Carefully, quietly, into the darkness of the canyon itself. I knew this descent. I'd made it just days ago, fleeing with my family to what we thought was safety.

Now I was making it again, but this time as prisoner. This time leading soldiers toward my family instead of running away from them.

Had I led them? The question tormented me. Would they have found the cave without me? Or was this my fault?

I was just a prisoner. A child. I hadn't told them anything, hadn't shown them the way, hadn't betrayed anyone.

But I was here. And they were following me. And somehow that felt like betrayal anyway.

We reached the lava field at the canyon bottom. The soldiers spread out, moving between the black rocks, heading toward the far side where the approach to the cave began.

The sky was starting to lighten. Not dawn yet, but getting close. In maybe an hour the sun would rise.

They were going to attack at dawn.

We crossed the lava field and gathered at the base of the slope leading up to the cave. I could see it now, a dark opening high above, barely visible in the pre-dawn gloom.

My family was up there. Sleeping. Unaware.

Burns checked his pocket watch. Whispered orders to his officers. The soldiers spread out along the base of the slope, positioning themselves.

Waiting for the signal.

Waiting for enough light to see by.

Waiting for dawn.

I couldn't stand anymore. My legs gave out and I sank to my knees on the rocky ground. A soldier grabbed my arm, kept me from falling completely.

Hayes crouched beside me. "Almost over," he whispered. "Soon it'll be over."

That's what I was afraid of.

The sky grew lighter. Gray becoming pink at the eastern horizon. The canyon walls beginning to show their colors—red and white and gold.

Beautiful. It was going to be a beautiful day.

Burns raised his hand. The signal to get ready.

The soldiers checked their rifles one last time. Fixed bayonets. Spread out into positions.

I could see the cave entrance clearly now in the growing light. Could see a figure there—one of the sentries, probably, looking out at the dawn.

Looking right at us without seeing us.

Not yet.

Burns's hand dropped.

And the soldiers began to climb.

***

I don't remember much of what happened next. My mind has blanked out parts of it, protecting me from memories too terrible to bear.

But I remember some things.

I remember the sound of boots on stone as the soldiers climbed. Quiet at first, then louder as they got closer.

I remember the moment the sentry saw them. His shout of alarm, cut short.

I remember gunfire. So much gunfire. The sound echoing off the canyon walls, multiplying, until it seemed like the whole world was exploding.

I remember screaming into my gag, trying to warn them even though it was too late. Too late by days, by hours, by seconds that had ticked away while I sat prisoner and helpless.

I remember someone pulling me up the slope, dragging me closer even though I tried to resist. Closer to the cave. Closer to the sounds of death.

I remember a soldier saying, "Captain wants the boy brought up."

I remember climbing. My feet moving without my mind telling them to. One step, another, another, up the steep slope toward the cave.

I remember reaching the ledge in front of the cave entrance.

I remember the smoke.

I remember the smell.

I remember—

No.

I can't write this yet. Even now, sixty-two years later, I can't write what I saw when I reached that cave.

The gag was still in my mouth so I couldn't scream. But I would have screamed if I could have. Would have screamed until my throat bled.

Instead I just stood there, a seven-year-old boy surrounded by soldiers and smoke and death, and my mind went somewhere else. Somewhere far away where this wasn't happening.

Somewhere safe.

But there was nowhere safe. Not anymore. Safety had died in that cave.

Everything had died in that cave.

Someone untied my hands. Took the gag from my mouth.

I didn't run. Didn't scream. Didn't do anything.

I just stood there and looked at what was left of my world.

And I became, in that moment, what I have been ever since.

The only one living to tell.
