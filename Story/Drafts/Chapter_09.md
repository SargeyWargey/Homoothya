# CHAPTER 9: FAMILY AND WITNESS

## 1889-1905

Chehata told me at the start of the planting season that a new life had taken root inside the home we were still learning to share. We were turning earth for melons near the river when she paused, pressed her palm against her belly, and smiled with a certainty that stopped my breath. I had survived years by reading faint signs on the ground, but I had never read a sign that spoke of hope the way her smile did. The river breeze carried the scent of cottonwood buds, and for the first time since I left the Army I let myself believe the coming year might give more than it took.

When the pains came that autumn, Hashduba sent for a midwife respected by every family along the river. The night was cold enough to fog the walls of our brush house, yet the room burned with cedar smoke and whispered prayers. I could not keep still. My hands remembered only how to pack a saddle or oil a rifle, not how to steady the woman I loved while she labored to bring our child into the world. Chehata gripped my fingers and told me to breathe with her. The midwife murmured in Yavapai, guiding her through wave after wave. Just before dawn a cry split the darkness, thin at first, then fierce. The sound cut through the years of silence I had carried from the canyon to the parade grounds. The midwife laid a squalling boy on Chehata's chest, his skin slick with birth, his hair black and tightly curled. Tears stung my eyes in a way no wound ever had.

We named him Solomon for the ledger the agency clerk insisted on keeping, and Wi'itha for the name Chehata whispered while she wrapped him in a cotton blanket. Solomon for the record that would follow him whenever white officials demanded proof he existed. Wi'itha for the story he would hear at the fire, the story of a boy whose first breath was welcomed with songs that had survived soldiers, relocations, and hunger. I wrote both names carefully on a scrap of paper and tucked it in the small box where we kept our few treasures: pieces of turquoise, the silver brooch Chehata wore when we married, a pressed sprig of sage from the morning she told me she was with child.

Fatherhood demanded a vocabulary I did not yet have. My own childhood had ended in blood and smoke, so I leaned on the wisdom of Chehata's mother, Saha. She sat with me during long afternoons while Solomon slept swaddled against her back. She taught me lullabies shaped like the river, each verse tied to the seasons. She corrected my pronunciation without embarrassment, tapping my chest when she wanted a deeper tone, smiling when the words finally rounded correctly. Sometimes she sang the same phrase again and again, telling me the meaning rested not only in the syllables but in how patiently they were carried. Solomon listened to both of us, and I realized we were learning together, father and son sharing the same classroom carved out of generations I had lost.

Work did not loosen its hold just because I had a child to cradle. I still rose before dawn to split mesquite or haul water for neighbors who could pay in beans or cloth. My hands blistered and healed, then blistered again. Yet every swing of the axe landed with purpose now. I was gathering more than firewood; I was gathering stories and songs to warm my family. When the agent cut rations, I took jobs guiding wagon trains across stretches of land I once scouted for the Army. The pay barely fetched flour and coffee, but each trip reminded me that the desert was still ours, however the maps were redrawn.

Two winters later another boy came crying into our home. We called him Carlos when we presented him to the superintendent and Mahkya when we wrapped him in a cradleboard decorated with abalone shells borrowed from Chehata's cousins. I had heard news of my cousin Dr. Carlos Montezuma through travelers who passed the trading post, each story painting him as a man who wielded education like a medicine staff. Naming our second son after him felt like a promise to bridge the distance between the paths we had taken. When I held baby Carlos close, I imagined writing to the cousin I had not seen since we were children, telling him there was a boy in San Carlos who carried his name like a drumbeat.

Daughters followed, each with her own rhythm. Katie arrived during a thunderstorm that rattled the walls. Charlotte took her first breath while the peach trees bloomed. Lula came breech, stubborn and strong, and Josie slipped into this world so quietly that Chehata had to coax her cry. We registered them with the names the clerk would recognize and gave them Yavapai names at our fire, names that tasted of mountains, rain, and the sharp sweetness of cactus fruit. At night our home glowed with lamplight and the sound of small voices learning two languages at once. Their laughter tangled with the crackle of the fire like wind through willow branches.

The community watched us, curious and cautious. Some elders nodded when I offered my labor or shared the little English I had been forced to learn. They saw how I deferred to Saha and Hashduba, how I carried my children in cradleboards and taught them to step carefully around ceremonial objects. Others kept a distance. They remembered the scout who rode at the edge of their camps. I did not argue with their memories. When accusations pricked at my back, I bowed my head and kept working. Trust, like fluency, returned slowly. Chehata never wavered. When whispers grew sharp she took my hand in view of everyone, reminding them of the man she had chosen.

As my children grew I found myself called to mediate more often between the people and the agency. I wrote letters for Hashduba demanding fair beef allotments, for widows whose husbands had died hauling freight, for young men arrested for leaving the reservation without passes. The agent's clerk sneered when I delivered petitions signed with names he could not pronounce, yet he read every word. I kept copies for myself, each letter a record of voices otherwise dismissed. My English, once a tool used against my people, slowly became a shield I could raise on their behalf.

Evenings belonged to instruction. Saha led us through the constellations, pointing out how the coyote shaped the sky. Chehata taught the children to grind corn on the metate, showing them how to keep the rhythm even so the meal would be fine. I sat beside them, copying phrases into a ledger I had purchased from the trader. Page after page filled with Yavapai words paired with the English terms that had replaced them in official reports. Wi'itha. Mahkya. Nahava for the smell of rain on dust. Tovokwe for the weight of grief that sits in the throat. I wrote not only for my children but for myself. Each word reclaimed was a stone laid back into the foundation of who I had been before soldiers burned my village.

We traveled whenever we could to visit relatives scattered by government orders. At Camp Verde I stood on the riverbank with elders who remembered the march to San Carlos. At Salt River I listened to families who had lost land to irrigation ditches carved for white settlers. We traded stories and seeds, promises and warnings. My children absorbed every lesson. They learned to greet each new campsite with gratitude, to leave offerings at springs, to listen when an elder spoke even if the words came haltingly in English. They saw the cost of survival etched into faces lined by wind and worry, and they understood that our comfort depended on the resilience of those who kept walking when everything familiar was stripped away.

Around the turn of the century rumors reached us that Fort McDowell might be reopened to Yavapai families willing to fight for it. The news stirred something restless in me. That land held the bones of my past, yet it also held the promise of water and fields our children could inherit. Chehata and I spoke late into the night, weighing the risks. Remaining at San Carlos meant enduring another generation under the thumb of officers who still considered us prisoners. Moving north meant facing memories I had locked away. We decided we would not let fear choose for us. We began to make trips to the Verde River, joining work parties that cleared irrigation ditches choked by years of neglect. My sons carried shovels shorter than their arms. My daughters gathered mesquite beans and sang to keep the little ones out of the canal.

During those trips I began to write more than vocabulary lists. I sketched the outline of ceremonies, noted the stories elders entrusted to me, and recorded the names of the canyons we passed. I kept the ledger hidden beneath our bedding, not because I feared my family would object, but because the act of writing felt like holding an ember that could either warm or burn. Sometimes I woke before dawn, careful not to disturb Chehata, and added a line about the way my mother's voice used to braid through the morning. Other times I forced myself to write about the march to San Carlos, describing the blistered feet of children and the way the soldiers laughed when elders stumbled. The words left me shaking, yet I understood that if I did not secure them on the page, they would vanish like footprints in wind.

My children started asking questions I had avoided. Solomon wanted to know why some elders refused to sit near me at council fires. Carlos asked why I had two names when most men had one. The girls wondered why I flinched when I heard sudden gunshots from the distant gunnery range. I answered carefully, giving them pieces of the truth without dragging them into the pit of memory. I told them I had once carried a rifle for the Army because I believed it might protect families from worse harm. I told them I had another name before Mike, a name I could not yet offer them without feeling the canyon walls closing in. Chehata listened, her hand resting on my knee, trusting that when the time was right I would finish the story.

By 1905 we were spending more days at Fort McDowell than at San Carlos. The mesquite groves there smelled like the ones from my earliest recollections, though I still could not speak those memories out loud. We planted corn in terraces built by our ancestors and taught our children to fish for suckers in the Verde. I became an interpreter for meetings with federal agents sent to inspect our progress. They saw a former scout who could translate their orders. I saw their visits as a chance to assert that our presence on that land was not a privilege granted by Washington but a right inherited through blood and burial.

Each evening the river sang the same patient song it had offered my people long before soldiers marked its banks with forts. I sat beside that water with my ledger and my fears. The chorus of my children's voices drifted from the brush houses, rising with the smoke of supper fires. Behind their laughter I heard the faint echo of another boy's cry, a boy whose name I had not spoken in decades. I had not yet mustered the courage to write his story in full, but the ink drying on the pages in my lap told me the day would come. For now I kept filling lines with the knowledge Chehata and her family had shared, preparing the ground so that when my children asked who they were, I could answer with more than silence.

The work of building a family taught me that witness is not only a duty to the dead; it is also a promise to the living. Every night I tucked my ledger beneath my sleeping mat and lay beside Chehata, grateful for the warmth of her shoulder against mine. She would whisper that tomorrow we would teach the children a new song or take them to visit an elder who had been asking for them. I closed my eyes and let the rhythm of her breathing steady me. Somewhere beyond the bend of the river my cousin Carlos was giving speeches and writing essays fierce enough to rattle congressmen. Here on the riverbank I was gathering words slower and quieter, yet no less sharp. The story that waited inside me was still locked behind a door I feared to open. My children, my wife, and this stubborn river were the keys resting in my palm.
