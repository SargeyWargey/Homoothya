# 9  |  LAND

### 1903-1905
### Fort McDowell, Arizona Territory
The letter arrived in winter, carried by a Phoenix trader who knew I read English. The envelope bore my name in bold script. Inside, Carlos Montezuma's handwriting ran neat and urgent across the page.

*Cousin,*

*I am writing to warn you. The Interior Department intends to remove Fort McDowell's people to Salt River Reservation. They claim the land is needed for the city's growth. They will say it is for your benefit. Do not believe them.*

*Keep McDowell land. Keep Verde River water. These are not theirs to take.*

*I am fighting for you in Washington and Chicago. But you must fight there, on the ground. Organize. Refuse. Make them hear your voice.*

*Your cousin,*
*Carlos*

I read the letter twice before folding it carefully and placing it in my ledger. Chehata looked up from the venison she was slicing for drying.

"What does he say?"

"They want to move us again."

Her knife paused mid-cut. "Where?"

"Salt River Reservation."

The blade struck the cutting board hard enough to split the wood beneath. "Among the Pima?"

I nodded.

"No." Her voice was flat, final. "The Pima killed our people. Guided soldiers to the canyon. My grandmother remembers their faces."

"I know."

"Then you tell them no." She pointed the knife at the letter. "You tell Carlos we are not moving. And you tell the agent the same."

I had never heard such steel in her voice. It steadied something inside me that had been wavering since the envelope arrived.

"I will."

The agency superintendent arrived three weeks later with maps rolled beneath his arm and a smile that never reached his eyes. He spread the maps across the table at the community center while families gathered to hear what he called a "generous opportunity."

"The Salt River Reservation offers superior farmland," he said, smoothing the corners with pale fingers. "More water. Better soil. Modern irrigation systems already in place."

He did not mention that those modern systems served white farmers downstream first.

"You'll be neighbors with the Pima people," he continued. "They've been very successful. You could learn from their example."

George Dickens, older than me by fifteen years and respected for his steady judgment, spoke first. "The Pima were scouts against us. They helped hunt our families."

The superintendent's smile tightened. "That was long ago. We must move forward."

"You're asking us to move forward by moving onto their land?" I kept my voice level, the way I had learned in Army service when addressing officers. "To leave our river for theirs?"

"The government owns all reservation land, Mr. Burns. We're offering you a better location."

"This is not your land to offer." The words came before I could measure them. "President Roosevelt reserved Fort McDowell for Yavapai use. That order stands."

The superintendent folded his map with deliberate care. "Executive orders can be modified. The needs of Phoenix are growing. Water must be allocated efficiently."

"Efficiently." I let the word hang in the air. "You mean given to white farmers."

"I mean used productively." His tone hardened. "Fort McDowell struggles to maintain its ditches. Salt River has permanent infrastructure."

"We struggle because you refuse to fund repairs." My hands remained flat on the table, but my pulse hammered in my throat. "Every petition we've sent requesting materials has been denied. Now you point to our broken ditches as proof we should abandon our homeland?"

Several men murmured agreement. The superintendent's jaw tightened.

"The decision isn't final. But I encourage you to consider carefully. Those who cooperate will receive priority in land assignments at Salt River. Those who resist..." He let the threat trail into silence.

After he left, the room erupted in overlapping voices. Some families were frightened, remembering how resistance had ended before. Others were furious, ready to refuse immediately.

George Dickens raised his hand for quiet. "Mike, you know the government's ways. What do we do?"

All eyes turned to me. I felt the weight of their trust and the memory of every time I had failed to speak for my people when it mattered.

"We document everything," I said. "Every broken promise. Every denied petition. Every acre we've cultivated without their help. We write it down, and we send it to Carlos in Chicago. He has connections in Washington. He can make noise where they have to listen."

"And here?" asked Charles Dickens, George's younger brother. "What do we do here?"

"We refuse. Together. If they come with papers, we don't sign. If they come with threats, we stand firm. And we keep farming. We keep our ditches running. We show them we belong to this land and it belongs to us."

Chehata stood at the back of the room with our youngest daughter on her hip. When our eyes met, she nodded once. The other women saw her approval and added their voices to the agreement.

That night I wrote to Carlos by lamplight while my family slept. I detailed everything the superintendent had said, every veiled threat, every broken promise that brought us to this moment. I listed the names of families who were ready to fight and those who were wavering. I described the fields we had planted without government seed, the ditches we had cleared without government tools, the homes we had built without government timber.

*They want us to disappear quietly,* I wrote. *To accept relocation as inevitable. But we have already been moved once. We walked the trail to San Carlos in winter and buried our dead along the way. We will not walk another trail for their convenience.*

*Tell them in Washington that we are not leaving.*

*Tell them the Yavapai are home.*

I sealed the letter and gave it to the Phoenix trader with coins earned from wood chopping. He promised delivery within the week.



Carlos's response arrived faster than I expected, accompanied by a bundle of newspapers. The *Chicago Tribune* carried an editorial about Indian affairs that quoted "Dr. Carlos Montezuma, a noted Yavapai physician." The *Arizona Republican* reprinted portions. Carlos had already begun making noise.

His letter was longer than mine, filled with legal arguments and political strategy.

*I have written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,* he explained. *I have sent letters to every congressman on the Indian Affairs Committee. I have contacted reform organizations in Boston and New York. They cannot move you quietly if the newspapers are watching.*

*But you must hold firm. If even one family signs relocation papers, they will use it as proof of consent. Everyone must refuse. Can you keep them united?*

I read that question three times. Could I?



The next Sunday I walked from home to home, carrying copies of Carlos's letter and the newspaper articles. I read them aloud. I translated the legal arguments into plain language about water rights and federal obligations. I reminded them what Salt River Reservation meant: living among the Pima who had scouted against us, leaving the river our ancestors knew, abandoning graves we had only recently been able to tend again.

Some families were convinced immediately. Others needed time. I visited them again the following week, and the week after that.

At night Chehata watched me copy petition drafts by lamplight. "You're becoming like Carlos," she said.

"Carlos has a medical degree and connections to powerful men. I have a pencil and anger."

"Anger can be enough." She placed her hand over mine, stilling the pencil. "But you have more than that. You have their trust. You lived what they lived. When you speak, they hear someone who understands."

I looked at the pages scattered across our table. Petitions. Letters. Lists of families who had agreed to refuse relocation. It wasn't much compared to Carlos's newspaper campaigns and congressional testimony. But it was something.

"Do you think it will work?"

"I think it has to." She squeezed my hand. "Because there is nowhere left to go. This is our last stand."



By spring the superintendent had visited three more times, each visit more insistent than the last. He brought maps showing Salt River's fertile fields and promises of new houses. He brought threats about withdrawing rations and closing the school. He brought individual offers to families he thought might break from the group.

Every time, we refused.

George Dickens became the unofficial spokesman, standing in council meetings to declare that Fort McDowell would not be abandoned. His younger brother Charles echoed the message to families who wavered. I wrote everything down and sent reports to Carlos with every trader heading to Phoenix.

The letters flowed both directions. Carlos sent news of congressional hearings where Fort McDowell's case was raised. He sent copies of *Wassaja*, the newsletter he had started publishing, which featured articles about our fight. He sent encouragement and warnings in equal measure.

*The Phoenix water interests are powerful,* he wrote in one letter. *They want the Verde River for their farms and the Salt River Project. They will not give up easily. You must be prepared for a long fight.*

I read that letter to the community council. "Carlos says this won't be settled quickly. Can we hold out?"

"We held out in the canyon," said an elder whose name was Yahya. "We can hold out here."

The analogy sent a chill through me. The canyon had been a siege that ended in a silence I still carried. But the old man's eyes were clear and determined. He knew what he was saying.

"Then we hold," I said.



Summer brought federal inspectors. They measured our fields and counted our livestock. They interviewed families about water usage and crop yields. They took notes in leather-bound books and asked questions designed to prove we were struggling.

I guided them personally, making sure they saw our successes. The corn standing tall in fields we had cleared ourselves. The irrigation ditches running clean despite flooding that destroyed the headgates twice. The children learning to read in a schoolhouse built with lumber we had hauled from the mountains.

One inspector, younger than the others, seemed genuinely curious. He asked how we managed without government support.

"We manage because we have to," I told him. "Your agency denies every funding request. So we do the work ourselves."

"Why not accept relocation to a reservation with better resources?"

"Because this is our land." I gestured toward the Verde River, brown and swift in the summer heat. "Our people lived here before there was a United States. We were forced to leave in 1875. We came back in 1903 because this is home. Home isn't something you abandon because someone offers you resources elsewhere."

He wrote that down. I don't know if it made any difference.



In the fall Carlos wrote that he was planning a trip to Washington to testify before Congress. He wanted Fort McDowell representatives to come with him.

*We need Yavapai voices in the hearing room,* he wrote. *Not just mine. Can you come? Can George or Charles?*

The community raised money for travel. It wasn't much, but it was enough for train fare. George Dickens and I were chosen to go, along with Carlos's brother-in-law who lived near Phoenix.

I had never been to Washington. The city was larger than I imagined, full of marble buildings and crowds that moved like rivers. Carlos met us at the train station wearing a suit that made him look like the doctor he was. His hair was graying at the temples, and his face carried the weight of battles fought in committee rooms rather than canyons.

"Cousin." He embraced me, then George. "Thank you for coming."

"We're here to speak for our people," George said.

"Then let's make them listen."
