# 9  |  PROMISES

### 1905-1909
### Fort McDowell, Arizona Territory
The evening settled over Fort McDowell with the kind of quiet that follows hard work. The children had scattered to neighboring fires, drawn by the promise of stories and roasted corn. Through the open doorway, I could hear Solomon's laugh mixing with his cousins' voices, the sound drifting across camp like smoke. It was the same calm that had followed the hearing in Phoenix, when voices and ink held the agents at bay. Sitting in that quiet now, I felt how our stories could guard the land as surely as any rifle.

Chehata sat across from me, her hands busy with mending. The lamplight caught the silver threading through her hair. We had spent the day clearing silt from the irrigation ditches, our backs bent to the same labor that had sustained our grandparents' generation. My shoulders ached in the familiar way that meant honest work, the kind that left you tired but whole.

I reached for the bundle of pages I had kept wrapped in oilcloth beneath our bedroll. The papers rustled as I unfolded them, edges worn from handling. They were the pages born from the ledger entries I'd begun after Carlos's last letter, testimonies gathered beside cook fires and irrigated fields. Each sheet pressed proof against my palm that the confidence I'd found before the committee had not faded. Chehata's needle paused mid-stitch.

"Is that what you've been writing?" she asked.

I nodded. My throat felt tight. "I need you to tell me if I captured it right." The words came out rougher than I intended. Power had come when I faced congressmen, but this felt more fragile; these pages held the memories of those who trusted me. "You know these stories. Your family lived through San Carlos. Your grandmother walked the March. Did I tell it true?"

She set the mending aside and straightened, giving me her full attention. The lamplight made shadows of the lines around her eyes, lines earned from raising six children, from years of drought and struggle, from carrying the weight of what our people had endured.

"Read it to me," she said.

I smoothed the first page against the table. My hands shook slightly. These were not just words. They were the testimony of elders who had trusted me with their memories, the accounting of promises broken and lives lost. If I had failed to honor them, I didn't know how I would face her.

"Mike." Chehata's voice was gentle. "Read."

I took a breath and began.

"I set this down so the world may know. The White People have heard only one side."

"The first time General Crook spoke the words, I carried a pitcher of water taller than my forearm." I paused, remembering the weight of the ceramic, the way it sloshed against my chest. "The general stood in the parade ground at Camp Verde with officers clustered around him and Yavapai leaders gathered across the packed earth."

Chehata leaned forward slightly.

"He lifted his hands and told them they could live at Rio Verde as long as they lived." I looked up from the page. "I was just a boy. I was standing near the doorway of Captain Burns's office. But I heard him say it."

"My grandmother told me about that promise," Chehata said quietly. "She said everyone believed it. They thought, finally, they could rest." Her jaw tightened. "They were wrong."

I continued reading. The words described the months that followed: the wagons arriving with flour and coffee, the fields planted, the reports of wheat and barley harvested. I read about Captain Burns's ledgers, the careful accounting of every pound issued, the officers praising the farming success.

"I wrote here: 'They proved they could do everything asked. It didn't matter.'" I stopped, uncertain. "Did I say that too harshly?"

Chehata's eyes flashed. "Not harsh enough. Say it again, louder. They did everything the Army asked. They surrendered. They farmed. They raised crops to feed themselves, so the government wouldn't have to. And still..." She stopped, pressing her lips together. "Keep reading."

I read about the sickness. About the epidemic that swept through Rio Verde in those first two years, killing nearly half the people gathered there. My voice caught when I reached the part about Dr. Williams.

"The people said Dr. Williams had poisoned them." I looked at the page, at my own handwriting documenting the accusation. "I heard the whispers in the officers' quarters. I was a child. I could not help my people. I could only watch them die from a distance."

"You were a child," Chehata said. Her hand reached across the table and covered mine. "But now you're writing it down. That's how you help. Keep reading."

I read the names: Grandma Dashkoda, Uncle Wahya, Mary Johnson, and John Williams. The survivors who had told me their stories by firelight, their voices threaded with grief even decades later. They had described the smell of orange blossoms before the sickness came, the taste of wheat they had grown themselves, the sound of children burning with fever through the night.

"Close to half the people at Rio Verde were gone," I read. "Disease had done what bullets had not."

Chehata's hand tightened on mine. I could feel the calluses on her palm, earned from years of grinding corn and hauling water. "My grandmother's sister died in that sickness," she said. "Her name was Kamala. She was fourteen."

I picked up my pencil and wrote the name in the margin. Kamala. Another name for the accounting the government would never make.

"What came next?" Chehata asked, though we both knew. The promise broken. The march.

I turned the page.

"'As long as they lived' became two years."

The words hung between us like smoke. Chehata's face hardened.

"The day the column formed, frost clung to the shaded side of the adobe wall," I read. "The people stood with bundles tied in blankets. Some carried clay pots, some carried tools, all carried the weight of disbelief."

I described the officer's announcement: the new order to march to San Carlos, the second promise that if they behaved, they could return in five to seven years.

"I knew, even at age ten, this was a lie."

I continued. The words described the morning the march began: the smell of cedar bundles and tanned hides, the soldiers reeking of oil and gunpowder. The wagons loaded with supplies but not carrying people. Everyone walked.

My voice roughened as I read the next part.

"I traveled with the soldiers who forced the march. I was fed while my people starved. I rode while they walked. I was warm while they suffered."

I had to stop. The words blurred on the page. Twenty days. Snowmelt turning the road to mud. The rations dwindling. Children collapsing. The father, who asked for wagon space for his dying son and was refused.

"I could do nothing," I read, barely above a whisper. "I was ten years old, in the care of the men who were destroying my people's lives."

"But you remembered everything," Chehata finished for me. "You remembered, and now you're writing it down. Keep reading, Mike. This is important."

I read about crossing the Verde River in water cold enough to numb feet. About the girl who nearly drowned. About rations spoiling, flour spilling into the dust, people chewing parched corn while soldiers drank coffee every morning.

Then I reached the East Verde.

"Tension had simmered for miles between Tonto families and the Apache Mojaves and Yumas," I read. "Old grievances rubbed raw under hunger and fatigue. As we halted to refill canteens, a shout cracked through the air."

I described the fight that erupted: the chaos, the violence, soldiers trying to force separation. Al Sieber riding into the fray and taking a bullet that crippled him for life. The thirty or more Tontos who lay dead on the rocks by the time officers regained control.

"We marched again before the earth could cool," I read.

Chehata had gone very still. "My uncle was there," she said finally. "He saw that fight. He said the blood ran into the river, and the water turned red downstream. He said they didn't even have time to bury the bodies properly."

I added another note to the margin. Her uncle's testimony. Another witness to add to the accounting.

The pages described the rest of the journey: sleet that stung skin raw, children learning to walk in step with soldiers or risk a rifle butt to the shoulders, elders wrapped in every scrap of cloth they owned. The prayers whispered for mountains and rivers and ancestors.

"The people walked across the boundary in silence," I read. "An official from the Indian Bureau stood waiting with a ledger. He counted heads as if the march had been an inventory exercise."

Chehata made a sound low in her throat, anger and grief mixed together.

I reached the end of the march section, the words I had written from memory, from the ache that had lived under my ribs for thirty years.

"Good-bye, my homeland, and water, and trees, and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land."

My voice broke on the last words. I had whispered them as a child standing on the dry ground of San Carlos, certain I would never see the Verde again.

"But I was wrong," I read through the tightness in my throat. "I did come back. And I am writing this so my people's suffering will not be forgotten."

Silence filled the space between us. Outside, someone laughed at a neighboring fire. The ordinary sounds of life continuing felt strange against the weight of what I had just read.

"You came back," Chehata said finally. Her eyes were wet. "We came back. That's our victory."

I read the final section, the testimonies I had gathered from survivors who had told me what I couldn't see as a child. The years at San Carlos. The starvation. The diseases. The families are torn apart. The dead buried far from their homeland.

"I set down every name they gave me," I read. "Every person who died because of broken promises. This is the accounting the government will never make, so I make it."

"My grandmother's sister," Chehata said again. "Kamala. She died at San Carlos in 1876. Add her name."

I wrote it carefully below the others. The list grew longer with each conversation, each story shared, each memory entrusted to my keeping.

"I witnessed the promises made," I read. "I witnessed the promises broken. I witnessed my people's exile. Now I witness their return to the Verde River. I am writing this because I am the only one living who was present at Rio Verde, present on the March, and present now at Fort McDowell."

I paused before reading the final line.

"This is my testimony. Let the White People read it and know what was done."

I set the pages down. My hands were shaking again. The lamplight flickered, making shadows dance across Chehata's face.

"Did I tell it true?" I asked.

For a long moment, she didn't answer. She stared at the pages spread across the table, testimony written in English letters she couldn't read but knew in her bones. Every word represented someone she had lost, something taken, some promise broken. Finally, she looked up and met my eyes.

"You told it true," she said. "This is what happened. This is what they did to us."

Relief flooded through me so strongly I had to close my eyes. "I wanted to honor what they suffered. What we all suffered."

"You did." Her voice was firm. "You witnessed it from a strange place, with the Army but not of them. Your heart with your people, but your body with the enemy. That makes your testimony powerful. You saw both sides. You can tell the White People what they did because you stood beside them when they did it."

I hadn't thought of it that way. The shame of my position during the march and the guilt of being fed while my people starved were burdens I carried. But Chehata was right. My strange position gave my testimony weight. I could document what I witnessed from inside the Army's ranks, things the people being marched couldn't have seen or known.

"Without you and your family teaching me what I'd lost," I said, "I couldn't have written this. I wouldn't have known enough to tell it right. The language, the stories, the names: your grandmother gave me those. Your mother, your aunts. They filled in what the Army took from me."

"And now you're giving it back," Chehata said. She gathered the pages carefully, stacking them as if they were sacred objects. "This needs to be published, Mike. The White People need to read what they did to us. What they took from us. What we survived despite them."

"I'll find a way," I said. "I have to. Carlos is shouting at Congress through his journal. We're proving ourselves here on this land. But someone needs to tell them what it cost us to get back here. What we lost. Who we lost."

"Write it all down," she said. "Every name. Every broken promise. Every mile of that march. And then make them publish it."

"I will." The determination settled into my chest, solid and sure. "I'll make them hear."

She rose and moved around the table, setting the pages carefully aside before resting her hand on my shoulder. "You're not just writing for the White People," she said quietly. "You're writing for our children. For Solomon and Carlos and Katie and Charlotte and Lula and Josie. So they'll know where they come from. What their grandparents survived. Why we fight so hard to stay here."

I covered her hand with mine. She was right. This testimony wasn't just about the past. It was about the future, about making sure our children and their children would know the truth. That they would understand why this land, this river, this home mattered enough to fight for.

Through the doorway, I could see the cook fires burning across Fort McDowell. Families gathered in the same spots where their grandparents had camped before the Army forced them away. The irrigation ditches we had cleared ran with water again, feeding fields of corn and wheat. The river that had called us home for generations still flowed through the desert, waiting for us to return to it.

We had come back. Despite the broken promises, despite the disease and death and exile, despite everything the government had done to erase us, we had come back.

And I would write it all down so no one could ever say it didn't happen.

"Come," Chehata said, pulling me to my feet. "The children will be home soon. Tomorrow, you can add the names I gave you. Tonight, just rest."

But I knew I wouldn't rest. Not completely. The testimony sat on the table between us like a living thing, demanding to be finished, to be shared, to be heard.

I would rest when it was done. When every name was recorded, every broken promise documented, every mile of suffering accounted for.

I would rest when the White People could no longer pretend they didn't know what they had done.

Not before.
