# Chapter 6: Six Days

The soldiers didn't leave.

For three days they stayed camped in the valley below, their smoke rising each morning and evening like a signal that they were still there, still searching. We lived in whispers. Moved like shadows. The fires stayed cold.

On the fourth day, they moved.

My father stood at the cave entrance with the other men, watching the line of mounted soldiers ride north along the canyon rim. They grew smaller and smaller until they disappeared into the broken country beyond.

"Gone," my uncle said. Relief in his voice. "Finally gone."

But my father didn't relax. "Or they're circling. Coming back from another direction."

"You think they know we're here?"

"I think they're looking. And they're persistent."

Still, with the soldiers out of sight, life in the cave began to loosen. People spoke in normal voices again. Fires were lit for cooking. Children who'd been forced to stay quiet and still for days were finally allowed to move around, to play in the back of the cave where the darkness was deep and their laughter wouldn't carry.

I played with them for a while, a game of hiding and seeking among the rock formations at the cave's rear. But my heart wasn't in it. Every time I heard footsteps approaching the entrance, I froze, listening, waiting for the alarm.

It never came.

That evening we had hot food for the first time in days. My mother made a stew with dried meat and the last of the prickly pear pads, cooking it in a basket by dropping hot stones into the water until it boiled. The smell made my mouth water. The warmth of it in my belly made me realize how cold I'd been, how tense, for how long.

My father ate without speaking, his rifle still beside him. He hadn't let it out of reach since we arrived.

"They're gone," my mother said quietly. "You can rest."

He looked at her, his face hard in the firelight. "They're not gone. They're out there. And they're coming back."

She didn't argue. Just pulled my sisters closer and stared into the fire.

That night I slept better than I had in days. The cave felt almost safe again. Almost like shelter instead of a trap. I dreamed of home—not the cave, but our real home, the camps we'd moved through with the seasons, the places where we'd gathered and hunted and lived before the soldiers came.

I dreamed of my mother. My first mother. Her hands sorting seeds. Her voice singing while she worked. The way she'd call my name when it was time to eat.

I woke in the darkness with tears on my face.

The fifth day started like the others. Gray light growing at the cave's mouth. People stirring, moving quietly, tending small fires. My mother nursing my youngest sister while my other sister played with stones near our sleeping mat, making them into a family—this one the mother, this one the father, this one the baby.

I went with the other boys to gather firewood again. We were allowed to go farther now, spreading out across the slope below the cave, searching for anything that would burn. The morning was cold, my breath visible in the air.

"My father says we might stay here all winter," one of the boys said. He was older than me, maybe ten. "Says we'll be safe until the soldiers give up and go back to their fort."

"All winter?" Another boy shook his head. "We don't have enough food for that. We'd have to go down to the valley to gather. To hunt."

"Can't do that if soldiers are patrolling."

"So what do we do? Starve?"

No one had an answer to that.

We carried our firewood back up to the cave in silence. The sun was higher now, warming the rock, turning the canyon walls gold. From up here I could see for miles—the broken country stretching away to the north, the mountains blue in the distance, the sky impossibly wide above.

Beautiful country. Harsh country. Our country.

And somewhere out there, soldiers were riding through it, looking for us.

I climbed back into the cave and added my firewood to our family's pile. My mother smiled at me, tired but trying not to show it. My father was at the entrance again with the other men, as he was every morning, watching.

The day passed slowly. Nothing happened. No soldiers appeared. No alarms. Just another day of waiting, of living small and quiet in the stone shelter.

That evening, Grandmother told stories.

She sat by one of the central fires with the children gathered around her—not just the young ones, but older kids too, and even some of the adults who sat at the edges, listening. I sat with my back against the cave wall, my younger sister in my lap, listening to Grandmother's voice echo off the stone.

She told the old stories. How the people came up from beneath the earth into this world of light. How Coyote brought fire and taught the people to use it. How the mountains and rivers and rocks all had spirits, all had power, all deserved respect.

"This cave," she said, her voice soft but carrying in the stillness, "is old. Older than your grandfathers' grandfathers. The stone remembers everyone who has sheltered here. The stone will keep us safe, if we honor it."

I wanted to believe her. I could feel the stone at my back, solid and ancient and strong. Maybe it did remember. Maybe it would protect us.

But stone hadn't protected my first mother. Stone hadn't stopped the soldiers from taking our land, destroying our camps, scattering our people.

Stone was just stone.

After the stories, after the fires burned low and people settled into sleep, I lay awake again. My father was on sentry duty at the entrance—I could see his silhouette against the stars, dark and still. My mother slept beside me with my sisters tucked close.

I thought about the stories Grandmother had told. About the people coming up into this world. About learning to live here, learning what the land could give, learning how to survive.

Had those first people been afraid like we were afraid? Had they hidden in caves from enemies they couldn't fight? Had they huddled in the darkness, hoping the stone would shelter them?

Maybe fear was just part of living. Part of being human in a world that was beautiful and harsh and indifferent all at once.

I closed my eyes and tried to sleep.

***

The sixth day was warmer.

Sunlight poured into the cave's mouth, bright and clean. The men said the soldiers hadn't been seen for two days—maybe they really had moved on to search elsewhere. Maybe we could risk sending out hunters soon, gatherers to bring back food and water from farther away.

My mother and aunt went down to the river to refill the water baskets. They took some of the older girls with them, and two men with rifles to stand guard. I watched them descend the steep slope, carefully picking their way down toward the canyon floor.

They came back safely before noon, the baskets heavy with water, everyone unharmed.

"No sign of soldiers," my aunt reported to the elders. "The canyon's quiet."

That afternoon, some of the children were allowed to play outside the cave. Not far—just on the ledge in front of the entrance, in the sunlight. We ran and chased and threw stones at targets, burning off energy we'd been holding in for too long.

It felt good to move. To be loud. To play like children instead of prisoners.

I climbed up on one of the boulders near the cave entrance and looked out at the canyon. The river far below, silver in the sunlight. The lava field we'd crossed, black and jagged. The canyon walls striped with color—red and white and gold.

"Careful," my father said. He was standing nearby, watching us play. "Not too close to the edge."

I backed away from the drop and jumped down from the boulder. My father looked different today. Less tense. Almost relaxed. Maybe he was starting to believe we really were safe here.

That evening we had another hot meal. My mother even managed to make mesquite cakes the way she used to, grinding the beans and mixing the flour with water, cooking them on hot stones until they were crispy on the outside and soft inside.

They tasted like home. Like normal. Like maybe things would be all right.

After we ate, I sat with my father at the cave entrance. The sun was setting, the canyon filling with that golden light that made everything look softer, kinder. A hawk circled high above, riding the thermals.

"Father," I said, "when will we leave the cave?"

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "When it's safe."

"But when will that be?"

"I don't know, Hoomothya." He put his hand on my shoulder. "But we'll know when it's time. We'll feel it."

I wanted to ask more—where we'd go, what we'd do, if we'd ever get our old life back. But I could see in his face that he didn't have answers. None of us did. We were living day by day, moment by moment, hoping.

That night I slept without dreams. Deep, exhausted sleep, my body finally releasing some of the tension it had held for so many days.

I didn't know it then, but it was the last peaceful sleep I would ever have.

***

The seventh day dawned cold and clear.

I woke early, before most of the others, and lay watching the gray light grow at the cave's mouth. My father was already awake, standing at the entrance as always. My mother slept beside me, one arm wrapped around my youngest sister.

Everything was quiet. Everything was normal. Everything was the same as it had been for the past six days.

I had no reason to think this day would be different.

I got up carefully, trying not to wake my sisters, and went to relieve myself at the waste area the men had dug near the back of the cave. When I came back, my mother was awake, rekindling our fire to make the morning meal.

"Hoomothya," she said, "go down the slope and gather more firewood. We're running low."

I nodded and headed for the cave entrance. My father was there with my uncle and two other men, talking in low voices. They looked serious, but they always looked serious in the mornings.

"—can't be sure," my uncle was saying.

"Better to assume they're still searching," my father replied.

They stopped talking when I approached.

"Going to gather wood," I said.

My father nodded. "Don't go far. And come back quickly if you see anything strange."

"I will."

I started down the steep approach, my bare feet finding holds on the loose rock. The morning air was cold on my face. The canyon was still mostly in shadow, but the rim across from us was catching the first sunlight, glowing gold.

Halfway down the slope I found a dead juniper branch and pulled it loose from the rocks. Further down, some dried manzanita. I gathered an armful, enough to keep me from having to make a second trip.

That's when I heard voices.

Not from the cave above. From below. From the direction of the lava field.

I froze.

The voices were speaking words I didn't understand. A language that was harsh, foreign. English.

I dropped the firewood and started to run back up toward the cave.

But I was too slow.

They came around the rocks below me, three of them, on foot—soldiers without their horses, moving quietly. They saw me the same instant I saw them.

"Hey! Boy!"

I scrambled upward, trying to reach the cave, trying to warn everyone. My feet slipped on loose stone. I caught myself with my hands, kept climbing.

Heavy footsteps behind me. Getting closer. A hand grabbed my ankle and pulled.

I fell hard on the rocks, the air knocked out of my lungs. Before I could get up, before I could scream, strong hands lifted me, held me. I kicked and struggled but they were too strong.

"Got one!" the soldier shouted. To others I couldn't see. "Young boy, maybe eight years old!"

More voices from below. More soldiers appearing. Too many. And then I saw him.

An officer, walking up the slope with the easy confidence of someone who knows he's in control. Taller than the others. Older. Gold bars on his shoulders catching the early light.

He looked at me with eyes that were neither cruel nor kind. Just... assessing. Like I was something he'd found and was deciding whether to keep.

"What's your name, boy?" he asked in English.

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Didn't speak his language. And even if I had, I wouldn't have told him.

He turned to one of the other soldiers. "Bring him. And keep him quiet. I don't want the others to know we're here yet."

A hand clamped over my mouth. My arms were pinned to my sides. I struggled harder, desperate now, thinking of my family in the cave above. My mother and father and sisters. All the people sleeping or just waking, unsuspecting.

I tried to scream a warning through the hand covering my mouth. Tried to bite it. Tried to make any sound that would carry up to the cave.

But they were already carrying me down the slope, away from my family, away from everything I knew. The last thing I saw before they took me around the rocks and out of sight was the dark mouth of the cave high above.

And then it was gone.

And I was alone with the soldiers.

And I knew with terrible certainty that everything had just changed forever.

But I didn't know yet—couldn't imagine—just how forever that would be.

December 22, 1872.

Six days before the world ended.
