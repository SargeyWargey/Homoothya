# Chapter 6: Six Days

The soldiers didn't leave.

For three days they stayed camped in the valley below, their smoke rising each morning and evening like a signal that they were still there, still searching. We lived in whispers. Moved like shadows. The fires stayed cold.

On the fourth day, they moved.

My father stood at the cave entrance with the other men, watching the line of mounted soldiers ride north along the canyon rim. They grew smaller and smaller until they disappeared into the broken country beyond.

"Gone," my uncle said. Relief in his voice. "Finally gone."

But my father didn't relax. "Or they're circling. Coming back from another direction."

"You think they know we're here?"

"I think they're looking. And they're persistent."

Still, with the soldiers out of sight, life in the cave began to loosen. People spoke in normal voices again. Fires were lit for cooking. Children who'd been forced to stay quiet and still for days were finally allowed to move around, to play in the back of the cave where the darkness was deep and their laughter wouldn't carry.

I played with them for a while, a game of hiding and seeking among the rock formations at the cave's rear. But my heart wasn't in it. Every time I heard footsteps approaching the entrance, I froze, listening, waiting for the alarm.

It never came.

That evening the meat ran out.

My mother scraped the bottom of the storage basket, finding only a few dried strips. She made a thin stew with prickly pear pads and what little meat remained, cooking it in a basket by dropping hot stones into the water until it boiled. Everyone got a portion, but it was small. Not enough. My stomach was still hollow after I finished.

"We need to hunt," my uncle said to my father that night. They sat by our fire, voices low. "Tomorrow. While the soldiers are gone. We can't wait any longer."

My father looked at the children, at the elders, at the mothers nursing babies. All of us getting thinner. "It's risky."

"It's riskier to starve."

A long pause. Then my father nodded. "At first light. You and me. We'll go to the mesa above, find deer or rabbits. Be back before dark."

But my uncle shook his head. "Not at first light. Dusk is better. Deer come out to feed when the sun's low. We can track them in the last light, have better chances."

My father didn't look happy about it, but he agreed. "Dusk, then. But we stay close. No chasing wounded game into the dark."

My uncle nodded, though I saw something flicker across his face. We both knew: if they wounded a deer and it ran, they'd have no choice but to follow. The group needed that meat too desperately to let it get away.

I fell asleep that night with my stomach growling, dreaming of venison roasting over fire.

The fifth day passed in hungry anticipation.

Everyone knew my father and uncle would hunt at dusk. The women prepared to process whatever game they brought back—even in the dark if necessary. The children were quieter, sensing the tension, the need for this hunt to succeed.

I watched the sun track across the sky, impatient for evening to come.

"Can I go with them?" I asked my father as the afternoon shadows lengthened.

He looked at me for a long moment. I was young, maybe seven or eight, but I'd been on hunts before. I knew how to move quietly. How to read tracks. How to stay downwind.

"Please," I said. "I can help. I won't make noise."

My uncle spoke up before my father could refuse. "The boy should learn. And three sets of eyes are better than two."

My father hesitated, then nodded slowly. "You do exactly as I say. No noise. No running ahead. If I signal you to freeze, you freeze. Understood?"

"Yes, father."

As the sun touched the western canyon rim, we prepared to leave. My father and uncle each carried a bow and a quiver of arrows. My uncle gave me a small hunting bag to carry whatever small game we might find—rabbits, quail, anything.

My mother pulled me close, her hands on my shoulders. "Be careful. Stay with your father. Come back safe."

"I will."

She kissed my forehead, then let me go.

We climbed up from the cave to the mesa above, moving quietly through the growing dusk. The air was cooling rapidly, that sharp cold that comes to the desert when the sun drops. My breath made small clouds.

Up on the mesa, the juniper and pinyon were dark shapes against the dimming sky. My father led us east, away from the canyon rim, toward a small valley where deer often fed on the brush in the evening.

We moved in silence, communicating only with hand signals. My uncle pointed: fresh tracks in the dust. Multiple deer, heading toward the valley. My father nodded and we followed.

The light was fading fast now, that brief time between day and night when the world turns gray and soft. Perfect for hunting. The deer would be feeding, focused on finding food before full darkness came.

We crested a low rise and there they were: five mule deer browsing on mountain mahogany in the valley below. Three does, a yearling, and a young buck.

My father and uncle moved into position, placing me behind them where I'd be out of the way. They nocked arrows. Waited for the right moment.

The buck lifted his head, testing the air.

My uncle's bow creaked softly as he drew. The arrow flew.

It took the buck in the chest, just behind the front leg. A good shot. Maybe perfect.

But the deer didn't fall. It wheeled and ran, crashing through the brush, the other deer scattering in all directions.

"Damn," my uncle breathed. "Hit him solid. He won't go far."

But as we watched, the deer disappeared over a rise, still running strong.

My father looked at my uncle in the fading light. "We agreed. No chasing into the dark."

"That arrow will kill him. Within the hour, maybe less. All we have to do is follow the blood trail. We can't let him die and let the coyotes have him. The group needs this meat."

They stood there in the growing darkness, the unspoken argument hanging between them. The need for caution. The equal need for food.

Finally my father nodded. "We track him. Carefully. We find him, dress him, and head straight back. We don't go far."

We followed the blood trail as darkness fell completely. Dark drops on stone. A smear on brush. The deer was bleeding, but not as heavily as my uncle had hoped. It was still moving.

We tracked for an hour. Then another. The deer kept going, kept moving deeper into the broken country beyond the mesa, farther from the cave.

"He should have fallen by now," my father said quietly. His voice held worry.

"The arrow's in him," my uncle insisted. "He has to drop soon."

And finally, he did.

We found the buck in a small clearing, collapsed on his side, his breathing labored and shallow. My uncle's arrow had gone through the lungs, but hadn't hit the heart. The deer had run farther than any of us expected.

My uncle dispatched him quickly with a knife. We stood in the darkness around the fallen deer, and I felt relief wash through me. We had meat. The group would eat.

But we'd gone much farther than planned. And it was fully dark now, the moon not yet risen. We'd have to dress the deer here and carry it back in darkness.

My father and uncle worked quickly, field-dressing the carcass by feel as much as by sight. I held the hunting bag, ready to collect the liver and heart—precious organs we'd eat first.

The work took longer in the dark. Everything took longer. By the time they finished, we were all shivering. The temperature had dropped, that deep cold that comes to the desert on winter nights.

"We need to move," my father said. "Get back to the cave while we can still find the way."

But my uncle was already gathering deadwood. "We're too cold. So is the meat. If we try to carry this back now, we'll freeze before we make it. We need to warm up first. Build a small fire, warm ourselves, then go."

"A fire could be seen."

"By who? The soldiers moved on days ago. And we're miles from where they were camped."

My father looked into the darkness, toward where the cave lay hidden. Then back at us, shivering. At the deer, cold and heavy. He was weighing the risks.

"A small fire," he said finally. "Just enough to warm us. Then we put it out and go. Agreed?"

"Agreed."

My uncle built the fire in a small depression, sheltered by rocks. He used juniper bark for tinder, dry twigs for kindling. The flames caught quickly, small and hungry, growing until we had a fire barely bigger than two hands.

But it was warm. Gloriously warm.

We huddled around it, holding our hands to the heat, feeling life return to our frozen fingers. My father kept watch while my uncle and I warmed ourselves. Then they switched, my uncle watching while my father thawed.

"Just a few more minutes," my uncle said. "Then we'll go."

But the cold had settled deep into our bones. A few minutes became longer. The fire felt too good. The warmth was too precious to leave.

I don't remember falling asleep. One moment I was watching the flames dance, the next I was being shaken awake by rough hands.

Not my father's hands. Not my uncle's.

Soldiers' hands.

I opened my eyes to see men standing around our fire—four, maybe five of them. White men in uniforms, rifles pointed down at us. More were emerging from the darkness beyond the firelight. Too many to count.

My father and uncle were already awake, already surrounded. My father's hand had moved toward his knife but stopped when he saw how many guns were aimed at us.

One of the soldiers kicked my uncle hard in the ribs. "On your feet. All of you."

We didn't understand the words, but we understood the tone. We stood slowly, hands visible, trying to show we weren't a threat.

An officer stepped into the firelight. Tall, with gold bars on his shoulders. He looked at us with cold assessment, then barked something in English.

One of the soldiers grabbed my father, forcing his arms behind his back. Another did the same to my uncle.

My uncle jerked away, trying to break free.

The gunshot was impossibly loud in the night.

My uncle staggered backward, his hand going to his chest. Dark blood welled between his fingers, black in the firelight.

"No!" My father lunged toward him, but the soldiers held him back.

My uncle fell to his knees, then onto his side. His eyes found mine across the firelight. Wide. Surprised. Already fading.

He tried to speak. Blood bubbled at his lips. Then he went still.

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Couldn't do anything but stare at my uncle lying dead on the ground, the firelight flickering across his open eyes.

The officer said something sharp in English. The soldier who'd shot my uncle lowered his rifle, looking shaken.

Then the officer turned to look at my father and me. Studied us. Made a decision.

He pointed at my father and said something. Two soldiers grabbed my father, forced him to his knees. One of them put a pistol to the back of my father's head.

"No!" I screamed. "No, please—"

The officer held up his hand. The soldier with the pistol waited.

The officer crouched down so he was at my eye level. He spoke slowly, in English, words I didn't understand. Then he pointed at the darkness around us, made a sweeping gesture. Asked a question.

I didn't understand.

He asked again, more insistent this time. Pointed at the darkness. Made a gesture like people hiding, people camping. Asked his question again.

He wanted to know where my people were. Where the cave was.

I looked at my father. His face was hard, determined. He shook his head once. Don't tell.

The officer saw. He said something to the soldier with the pistol.

The soldier cocked the hammer.

"Where?" the officer asked in accented Yavapai. One of the few words he knew. "Where people?"

I looked at my uncle's body. At my father with a gun to his head. At the soldiers surrounding us, so many soldiers, all with weapons.

I was seven years old. Maybe eight. I didn't understand politics or war or the weight of the choice I was making.

I only knew I didn't want my father to die the way my uncle just had.

"Cave," I whispered in Yavapai. Then, not knowing if they understood, I pointed. Toward where the canyon lay in the darkness. Toward where my mother and sisters and grandmother slept, unaware.

My father made a sound like something breaking.

The officer stood up. Smiled. Said something to his men.

The gun came away from my father's head.

I'd saved him. I'd done it. They wouldn't kill him now.

But then two soldiers grabbed my father and dragged him away from the fire, into the darkness. I heard struggling. A muffled cry. Then a thud and silence.

"Father!" I tried to run to him but hands held me back.

When they brought him back into the firelight, he was unconscious, a dark bruise swelling on the side of his head. They tied his hands and feet and left him lying near the fire.

The officer gestured to me, said something. A soldier picked me up. I struggled, bit, kicked, but it was useless.

They tied my hands too. Sat me down beside my father and uncle's body.

My father's eyes fluttered open. He looked at me, and in his eyes I saw something I'd never seen before.

Disappointment.

I'd betrayed them. I'd told the soldiers where to find them. I'd doomed everyone.

"I'm sorry," I whispered. "I'm sorry, father. I didn't want them to kill you."

He closed his eyes and turned his face away.

The soldiers gathered around their officer, talking in low voices, making plans. Every few minutes one would look toward the darkness where I'd pointed, toward where the cave lay hidden.

They knew now. They knew where to find my people.

And it was my fault.

I sat in the cold darkness beside my dead uncle and my unconscious father, my hands tied, my heart broken, understanding finally what I'd done.

I'd saved my father's life.

But I'd condemned everyone else.

December 27, 1872.

The night the world began to end.

**Historical notes:**
- The historical record indicates Mike Burns was captured shortly before the December 28, 1872 massacre
- The exact circumstances of his capture are not fully documented in primary sources
- This version dramatizes a plausible scenario: a desperate hunting trip, the fatal decision to build a fire, and a child's impossible choice under threat of death
- Mike Burns later recounted witnessing the massacre; this narrative explores how he may have been captured and his role in revealing the cave's location—a burden of guilt he may have carried for life
