### July 1885
### Highland University, Kansas
The last missionary I heard at Highland traced the Arizona Territory on a map hung behind the pulpit. He smudged chalk across the Salt River and called it a land of empty mesas waiting for Christian plows. I sat in the back pew and kept my hands folded. I knew the names of the mesas he called empty.

Two mornings later, President Craig asked me to bring my books to his office. He unfolded a letter bearing the blue stamp of the Indian Bureau and slid it across his desk. Captain Pratt wrote that federal funds would no longer cover students who wished to stay at Highland. If I remained, I would need to pay my own board. If I could not, I was to report back to the agency in the Territory before the end of July. The words were clipped, the ink already fading along the fold.

I had no savings beyond the few dollars I earned pruning trees. I sold my algebra text to a younger student, traded my winter coat to the farm foreman for a train voucher, and packed my trunk with the care one uses for a borrowed thing. That night, I walked the crest of the hill and watched lightning split a bank of clouds far to the south. The air carried the smell of rain moving away from me.

The journey home reversed everything Highland had tried to teach me. Kansas slipped by in squares of wheat and corn. Colorado brought the taste of dust. In New Mexico, the stations were little more than telegraph poles and weary mules. Each time the train slowed, men in army coats boarded and asked if any passengers were headed for the reservations. I kept my answers short and told them I was visiting family. It was not entirely a lie.

I reached Prescott after four days of rattling wheels and stiff benches. Governor Tritle's banners still hung across Montezuma Street, though the town already felt tired from the Fourth of July celebrations. My letter instructed me to report to the Indian agent there. His office occupied a corner of the post trader's store. He glanced at Pratt's orders, added my name to a list of interpreters already longer than his ledger, and told me there was no work. "Try San Carlos," he said. "Maybe the superintendent there needs a clerk."

Stage fare to San Carlos cost more than I had left. I took a wagon south with a freighter hauling flour to Fort McDowell and paid him with the last silver dollar from my trunk. The fort looked smaller than I remembered. The parade ground was rutted with wagon tracks, and the adobe walls shed flakes like sunburnt skin. The Pima laborers who once hauled water there had been dismissed. A few Yavapai families lingered in canvas tents along the riverbank, waiting for rations that came late and thin.

For a week, I asked for work that matched the schooling Highland had promised would save me. The fort had no clerkships. Phoenix merchants wanted bookkeepers whose fathers were already partners. The Maricopa superintendent offered me a shovel and told me I would be paid in scrip redeemable only at his store. I spent my evenings sitting outside the empty barracks and watching the sun fall behind the McDowell Mountains. The light there is the color of copper when it dies.

Sergeant Keane found me on the eighth day. He had ridden courier routes with Captain Burns in the old days and remembered the way I shined boots as a boy. He said General Miles had ordered more scouts to patrol the Tonto Basin. Rumors carried tales of Apache families slipping away from San Carlos and of miners calling for protection. Keane said the pay was decent and the rations regular. "Men with your eyes could follow a sign better than any raw recruit," he told me. "You know this country."

I told him I also knew what the Army had done in this country. The words came out sharper than I intended. Keane lowered his gaze and rubbed his thumb along a crease in his glove. He said the orders would be filled with or without me. If I enlisted, he argued, I could make sure the younger scouts were treated fairly. I could send money to friends still at school. I could keep the peace inside the patrols before others turned them into hunts. He spoke as if the choice carried more kindness than blood.

That night, I walked to the bend in the Verde River where the current slows and the reeds bow together. I took off my boots and let the water erase the dust from the trail. The stars leaned close enough that their reflections rippled at my feet. A coyote called from the ridge. In the sound of running water, I heard echoes of another river, another canyon, another day when soldiers raised their rifles and smoke filled the sky. I pressed my palms to my ears until the memory quieted. I told myself that if I joined, I could keep other canyons from filling with the same smoke. I told myself the Army would move on with or without me, and I was tired of standing outside decisions made in my name.

The enlistment clerk set out a single sheet of paper. The date read July 18, 1885. He asked my age, my height, the color of my eyes. He wrote "Mike Burns" in a careful hand and left a space for my mark. My fingers trembled as I signed. For a moment, I imagined scraping the ink away and walking out. Instead, I pressed the pen back into his palm and listened to his instructions about equipment issue and pay muster.

They handed me a blue wool blouse that smelled of creosote and storage. The brass buttons caught the sun and flashed in my eyes. The fabric fit across my shoulders with the stiffness of armor. I pulled it on anyway. The weight of it settled against my chest like a stone. This was the uniform of the Army that killed my people. Now it was mine to wear. I promised myself that each time I fastened those buttons, I would remember whose blood had darkened them first. I promised I would carry that memory farther than any patrol route they drew on their maps.
