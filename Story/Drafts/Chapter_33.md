# CARLOS AND MIKE'S SHARED LEGACY
Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns represented two paths toward the same goal: Indigenous survival, sovereignty, and witness.

Carlos used the education forced upon him at the Indian School in Illinois to become a physician. He graduated from the University of Illinois, then Northwestern Medical School. He practiced medicine in Chicago, serving both white and Native patients. He used his platform to publish Wassaja magazine from 1916 to 1922, calling for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and demanding Native American citizenship and self-determination. He co-founded the Society of American Indians in 1911. He wrote, spoke, and challenged federal Indian policy in public forums that few Native people could access.

Mike used his education at Carlisle Indian School and his bitter experience as an Army scout to become a witness. He chose documentation over activism, testimony over speeches. He spent decades writing his account, attempting to get it published so that the Yavapai perspective would be heard. He registered to vote in 1908, becoming the first Native American registered voter in Arizona Territory, asserting citizenship on his own terms.

Together with other Yavapai leaders, including Charles and George Dickens, Carlos and Mike worked to establish Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land.

The reservation was officially established by executive order on September 15, 1903. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the order creating 24,680 acres from abandoned Fort McDowell Military Reserve land. This victory secured a land base for Yavapai people who had been imprisoned at San Carlos Reservation for 25 years following the 1875 March of Tears.

The irony was stark and bitter. The reservation was carved from the military post that had served as a base for operations against the Yavapai people, including the Skeleton Cave Massacre.

Their homeland stolen, their families murdered, their children taken to boarding schools designed to kill their culture, and finally, they won the right to live on land named after the fort that had coordinated their destruction.

It was a victory. It was also a wound that would never fully heal.
