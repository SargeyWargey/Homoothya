# Chapter 5: The Cave

I woke to gray light filtering into the cave and voices whispering urgently near the entrance.

For a moment I didn't remember where I was. The stone ceiling above me was wrong, too close and too dark. The air smelled of dust and cold rock instead of sage and juniper smoke. Then it came back—the climb, the cave, the first night sleeping on hard stone with seventy-six people breathing in the darkness around me.

My father was already gone from beside me, his sleeping mat empty. My mother was awake too, sitting up with my baby sister in her arms, her face tight as she looked toward the cave mouth where the men had gathered.

"What is it?" I whispered.

"Shh." She didn't look at me. "Stay quiet."

I sat up slowly, careful not to make noise. Other children were awake too, pressed against their mothers, silent and watching. The elders sat near their fires, faces grave.

My uncle came back from the entrance and crouched by our fire. He kept his voice low.

"Soldiers. In the valley. They're camped maybe three miles south."

My father nodded. "Did they see our tracks?"

"Hard to say. They're just camped. Could be passing through."

"Or they're searching." My father's hand rested on his rifle. "We stay inside today. No one goes out. No smoke."

My uncle moved to the next family group, passing the word. Stay inside. Stay quiet. Don't show ourselves.

I looked toward the cave entrance. In the growing daylight I could see more of the canyon—the far wall catching the first sun, the shadows still deep in the canyon bottom. Somewhere down there, soldiers had made camp. Somewhere down there, men were waking up, starting fires, preparing to continue their patrol.

Looking for us.

My mother pulled me close, her arm around my shoulders. Her heart was beating fast. I could feel it through her dress, quick and frightened.

"It's all right," she whispered. "They won't find us. We're too high. The cave is hidden from below."

I leaned against her and said nothing. Around us, the cave fell into a careful silence. Fires banked to nothing. Conversations stopped. Even the babies seemed to sense the need for quiet, fussing less, sleeping more.

We waited.

The day passed slowly. Sunlight moved across the cave mouth as the sun tracked across the sky, but we stayed back in the shadows. A few people moved carefully to the entrance to look out, to watch the valley, to see if the soldiers moved on.

They didn't move on.

By afternoon we could see smoke from their camp rising in a thin line to the south. My father stood at the entrance for a long time, watching.

"Maybe they'll leave tomorrow," my aunt said. But she didn't sound like she believed it.

We ate cold food—dried meat, mescal, mesquite cakes. No fires to cook with, nothing hot. The water in our basket was getting low. Someone would have to go down to the river soon to refill the baskets, but not while the soldiers were camped so close.

As the sun set and darkness came again, we rolled out our sleeping mats in the same places as the night before. But tonight felt different. Tonight the cave didn't feel like shelter.

It felt like a trap.

I lay between my parents again, staring up at the dark ceiling. My father wasn't sleeping. I could tell by his breathing, by the tension in his body, by the way his hand never left his rifle.

Somewhere in the darkness, a child whimpered. Was shushed. Fell silent.

The stone was cold. The darkness was complete. And somewhere three miles south, soldiers slept around their campfires, and in the morning they might move on.

Or they might come closer.

I pressed against my mother's side and tried not to think about what would happen if they found us here. Tried not to think about how high we were, how steep the approach, how there was only one way in and one way out.

Tried not to think about being trapped.

But I thought about it anyway. All night, I thought about it.

And when I finally slept, I dreamed of soldiers climbing toward us, their footsteps echoing off stone, getting closer and closer until there was nowhere left to run.
