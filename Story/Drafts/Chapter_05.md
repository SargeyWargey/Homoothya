# 5  |  SCOUT

### 1885-1888
### Arizona Territory
The second dawn after I enlisted found me standing in a line of wool coats while the bugle scattered swallows from the barracks roof. Keane strode in front of us with a ledger tucked beneath his arm and the self-assurance of a man who had never wondered which name to answer to. The quartermaster said our pay matched the cavalry, twelve dollars a month if we kept our boots mended and our rifles clean. His eyes slid over us as if he expected one of us to bolt before muster ended. Equal wages did not buy equal trust.

We came from everywhere the Army had planted flags. White Mountain men who knew the Mogollon Rim like their own blood. San Carlos Apaches who had traded the ration line for a uniform that still smelled of the storeroom. Yavapai from the Verde, Mohave from the river, and a Pima scout who could read the weather better than any officer. I stood among them with my collar button choking the words I wanted to say about what this coat had already cost me. Soldiers leaned against the railing and watched us, trading jokes about whether we would vanish into the hills at the first rifle report. One corporal muttered about Cibicue and how you could never be certain which way an Indian would turn once the fighting started. His companion reminded him that the Army called us its eyes and ears. No one said who owned the rest of the body.

Training blurred heat and dust into a single taste. We drilled with Springfield rifles until my shoulder bloomed with bruises shaped like crescent moons. Keane made us shoot prone over and over, insisting that a scout had to disappear into the earth to survive. Between volleys, he lectured about the jobs set before us. Guide the columns. Guard the wagon trains. Fight beside the cavalry when orders demanded it. Translate every threat and promise the officers needed to deliver. He said the Army had mapped every trail worth knowing, but when we left the drill field, he handed me the lead because my feet knew this land. I did know this land; I had rehearsed these names of mountains and valleys many nights. The Yavapai names. The realization gave me pause. I had not forgotten.

At noon, we gathered near the commissary to chew hardtack and talk in the low voices of men who did not trust the wind. Nockay, a Mohave Yavapai who had married during his last enlistment, told me the officer's wives complained about the scouts who brought their families to the fort. They said the women cluttered the parade ground with cooking fires. Chatz, who had slipped away from the San Carlos guardhouse, teased that the real offense was that the scouts' children laughed louder than the white ones. We traded rumors in a mix of Apache and English, sometimes Pima words I had learned on patrol. The Yavapai phrases came harder now, clumsy in my mouth like stones I could not spit out. When the cavalrymen passed, we switched to English entirely so no one could accuse us of plotting. The habit of burying what remained of my first language felt like swallowing grit.

Our first patrol left Fort McDowell beneath a moon thin as a shell casing. Lieutenant Young rode at the front with four regulars whose boots gleamed as if they expected the desert to salute them. Keane set me on point with Nockay because, he said, my eyes knew the basin better than any map. The night air smelled of mesquite sap and the distant wet breath of the Verde. Even before the sun rose, the ground told me stories. A cholla spine snapped under a hurried heel. A scrap of willow bark twisted into a knot showed where someone had marked a turn toward water. The prints in the wash belonged to families moving quick, one set of toes dragging as if a child limped beside the rest.

We found the camp near Horseshoe Bend. Two families huddled around a fire banked low to hide the glow from the ridgeline. When the lieutenant ordered them to stand, the elder woman’s gaze slid past his saber and fixed on my face. She wore copper beads braided into her hair. I had seen beads like those on my mother’s wrists the last morning she lifted me from my blanket. I spoke the lieutenant’s orders in Yavapai, the syllables thick from disuse. I told them the Army insisted they return to San Carlos. The copper beads did not tremble. She spat in the dirt at my boots and asked whose son I thought I was. I told her there were soldiers with rifles behind me who were not interested in the story of my birth. She replied that the river kept memory longer than any ledger and that it would name me whether I liked it or not.

We escorted them back to the fort and then to the agency gate. On the march, the men cursed us in English and Apache, even though it was the officers who set the pace and ropes. One boy stared at me until the skin between my shoulders went cold. At the stockade, the superintendent praised the lieutenant for his efficiency and pressed a tally slip worth seven dollars into my palm. He never lifted his eyes from the paper ledger while he spoke. I filed their names and the date inside the small notebook I carried tucked against my ribs. The clerk called that notebook Army business. I knew better. It was the only map I trusted.

The days that followed tasted of alkali and copper. Some patrols escorted wagon trains loaded with flour bound for the Verde camps. Others rode toward the Tonto Basin to chase miners’ ghosts. We slept on the ground more nights than we spent under the fort’s roof, because the officers believed the desert would confess its secrets if we pressed our ears against it long enough. They called us brave when we navigated a canyon by starlight. They called us savages when we walked barefoot to feel the temperature of the earth. I learned to keep my expression smooth while they argued over whether we should wear regulation hats or the headscarves our mothers taught us to wrap against the sun. Nothing about their debate changed the fact that we carried the same rifles and faced the same arrows.

In the fall of 1885, word trickled through the ranks that Geronimo had slipped again into Mexico. The posts buzzed with the names of officers racing to claim the honor of tracking him. Courier riders clattered into McDowell carrying reports from Fort Apache and Fort Bowie. They spoke of Gatewood’s scouts, men with White Mountain blood who knew every draw from the Salt River to Sonora. We quieted when the messengers hinted that the scouts who helped bring Geronimo in might be shipped east with him. The Army called it precaution. We called it betrayal. If loyalty could not keep a man from chains, what chance did conscience have?

Late that winter, we intercepted another small group near the Salt River. A man wore surplus cavalry trousers cut at the knee, evidence of another enlistment gone sour. He raised an old Henry rifle and took two steps toward me before I spoke. In Yavapai, I told him the lieutenant would not hesitate to fire. The words came rougher than I wanted, shaped more by Army need than by the way my mother's people had spoken them. He asked if I remembered the prayer our elders chanted before the cedar smoke was lit. My throat tightened. I told him to lower the rifle because I could not bear to watch the regulars pull their triggers. The words bought us ten seconds and spared the children behind him from the volley.

When my first enlistment ended in December 1886, Keane handed me a discharge slip and told me to think on the opportunity before I let it pass. I took the paper and tried to breathe air without the taste of powder. For a month, I mended saddles, hauled water for elders who no longer trusted the agency pump, and offered to translate petitions for families robbed of their ration tickets. Each time I stepped inside the superintendent’s office, I saw the names of the people we had escorted scribbled beside phrases like disorderly or requires close observation. The ink dried while the hunger sharpened their bones. Equal pay, unequal judgment. My own purse emptied before the first spring rains.

Keane found me again in June 1887, leaning against the fort fence with soles worn through to my socks. He pressed a fresh enlistment form into my palm and said the columns moving toward the Mexican line needed men who could read signs faster than young lieutenants could unfold maps. He promised an extra dollar a month if I agreed to act as interpreter whenever the officers met with Apache headmen. He reminded me that without scouts to steady the patrols, the regulars might turn every search into a hunt. I thought of the families we had already bound and the ones hiding in canyons I refused to name aloud. I signed, and the guilt went down like sand.

The second enlistment carried us farther east than any map I had studied in the Highland classroom. We rode toward the Dragoons and the Sierra Madre, following rumors that Geronimo gathered his remaining fighters near the border. We never caught sight of him, only the aftermath of hurried camps: ash still warm, mescal hearts half dug from pits, prints where a horse had stumbled and regained its stride. Nights were spent wrapped in blankets stiff with sweat while the stars crowded so close I felt I might fall into them. The White Mountain scouts in our detachment moved like shadows. They rarely spoke unless spoken to, but when they did, they reminded us that their cousins serving under Gatewood had been promised fair treatment and had instead been chained to transport wagons bound for Florida. The lesson hung heavier than any cartridge belt.

The Army called us guides, yet every officer carried a compass as if the needle could replace the knowledge held in our feet. They called us fighters, yet they kept us out of their mess tents unless they needed a quick lesson in how to read a cloudbank. They called us guards, then left us to sleep on bare ground while the regulars rolled their bedrolls beneath canvas. I took note of each slight because I needed proof that I was not imagining the distance they insisted on keeping. When a captain complimented my penmanship and asked me to copy his reports, I did it for the extra ration, not for his approval. My handwriting preserved the dates; my notebook kept the truth.

One patrol dragged us through a canyon so narrow the sun barely touched the sand. The trail dissolved into stone, and the lieutenant ordered us to spread out and feel for prints with our fingertips. I found a heel mark, shallow but fresh, alongside the indentation of a woven basket. A family. I signaled the others to slow, praying the wind would swallow our scent. We discovered them crouched near a seep, two boys and their mother. The older boy lifted a stone axe. I spoke to him softly, promised that no bullet would fly if he let the handle drop. He asked whether the Army would let them keep their freedom if they promised to leave the territory. I could not lie. I told him the truth as the government defined it. The boy laid the axe down, and his mother began to sing. The melody clung to my skin for weeks.

When we returned to Fort McDowell after that patrol, the post commander ordered the scouts to parade so a visiting dignitary from the Department of Arizona could inspect us. We stood in ranks while he circled with his gloves clasped behind his back. He told the assembled officers that an Indian fighting as an Indian was the best soldier the Army possessed. His gaze slid past the notebook I held behind my belt. He did not mention what happened to those soldiers once their usefulness ended.

By the end of 1888, the scout detachment at McDowell began to empty. Some men carried their pay to new jobs hauling freight. Others disappeared into the hills before their discharge papers could be filed. I finished my term and carried my rifle to the armorer. He scribbled my name on a receipt and reminded me to turn in the cartridge belt. Keane clapped my shoulder and told me I had done the Army proud. I stepped outside with the evening light pooling copper along the river. The uniform hung heavy with sweat, dust, and the sorrow of every family we had marched south.

I kept the notebook hidden beneath my blouse until I reached the bend in the Verde where the water slows and reflects the sky. There I read the names aloud, one by one: the elders from Horseshoe Bend, the families caught near the Salt, the mother who sang in the canyon, the boys whose eyes accused me of wearing the wrong colors. The current carried their syllables away, yet the echo settled in my ribs. The Army had taught me to see every bent blade of grass, every faint track across rock. It had also taught me the cost of letting those eyes serve anyone but my own people. I left the grounds that night with the weight of that knowledge pressed under the last brass button. Whatever the officers wrote in their ledgers, I knew whom I had served and whom I had betrayed, and I would carry that ledger long after the Army struck my name from its rolls.
