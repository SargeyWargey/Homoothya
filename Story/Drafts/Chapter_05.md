# CHAPTER 5: HIGHLAND

## 1885-1886

The train that carried me away from Carlisle rolled across states I had only memorized from schoolroom maps. I watched the names stitched onto the depot signs slide past the windows: Pittsburgh, Columbus, Indianapolis. Each whistle stop smelled different. In Ohio it was lake wind and coal. In Illinois it was damp soil and the sweet scent of fermenting corn. By the time the cars clattered into Kansas the horizon had opened like a book laid flat. The sky stretched so wide that it felt as if an ocean had been turned upside down and nailed above the prairie.

Highland was a hilltop town that rose from the tall grass with a steeple and a handful of brick buildings. The university sat at the crest, its white columns facing fields that rolled toward the Missouri line. A Presbyterian minister met me at the station in Troy with a buggy. He wore a collar and a winter coat frayed at the cuffs. He studied the recommendation letter that Pratt had sealed with the school's crest and nodded as if he could already picture me seated in their chapel choir. The road from Troy to Highland cut through bare orchards and farmsteads where smoke curled steadily from chimneys. The air carried the metallic bite of frost and the faint aroma of wood ash. It reminded me of dawn at Carlisle, except there were no barracks, no bugles, no long lines of boys marching with their hands at their sides. Horses, not bells, set the rhythm here.

The campus itself was small enough that I could cross it in the time it took to recite the Lord's Prayer. There was the main hall with its belfry, a brick dormitory for the young men who came from farming families, a plain wooden building for the women's course, and a chapel that doubled as lecture room. I was assigned to a narrow room beneath the eaves, a bed pushed against one wall and a desk against the other. The window faced west. At dusk the sun poured across the fields in a river of gold and the prairie grasses bent in a single direction like congregants bowing in prayer. For the first time since I had been taken to Bishop's household I slept without a hall monitor listening for whispers in a forbidden tongue.

Classes began the morning after my arrival. The bell atop the hall rang at six. Instead of drill we walked to chapel, the students shuffling in boots still dusted with hay. I recognized only a handful of faces from Carlisle. Most of the seats were filled by sons and daughters of settlers who treated the college as a ladder toward ministry, law, or teaching. They wore wool coats sewn by their mothers and carried books that smelled of linseed oil. The faculty sat behind the pulpit. President Craig, with his gray beard and spectacles, asked me to stand and introduce myself. I said, "My name is Mike Burns. I come from Arizona Territory by way of the Carlisle Indian School." A few heads turned. One girl in the front row watched me as if she expected feathers to spring from my shoulders at any moment. When I sat down the boards creaked under my weight and the bell rope swayed gently overhead.

The curriculum felt like a door opening and slamming in the same motion. Algebra leapt beyond anything Miss Burgess had drilled into us. Rhetoric classes demanded we memorize arguments built on books I had never touched. The professors spoke quickly and picked students the way officers pick scouts, by reputation. I answered in English that Carlisle had polished, but the work moved faster than I could catch. Each night I copied equations twice, only to find other students already far ahead when morning recitations began. Professor Merrill still clapped when I managed a clean speech, calling me proof that Carlisle produced miracles, yet I knew I was clinging to the middle of the class with raw fingertips. Miracles were supposed to save souls, not smooth them down until they matched the grain of a table.

There were freedoms here that Carlisle had never permitted. In the afternoons I worked in the orchard to pay my board, pruning trees and hauling crates of apples to the root cellar. No matron inspected my hands for dirt. No monitor followed me to be sure I spoke nothing but English. I could walk into town without seeking permission, so long as I returned before the lamps were doused. I wandered the crest of the hill and watched storm fronts pile up on the horizon. I listened to the whistle of wind in the cottonwoods and tried to recall the exact pitch of the breeze that wound through the sycamores along the Verde River. Memory arrived in pieces. The smell of damp leaves. The sting of cold water on bare feet. A lullaby hummed in a tongue no one here would recognize. I whispered it under my breath as I sharpened pruning shears and promised myself I would not forget the vowel sounds that once held me together.

For all its quiet, Highland had its own discipline. Each week we recited scripture before supper. Each month a missionary visitor stood at the chapel lectern and spoke of the heathen wilderness beyond Kansas. Their maps ended at the Rockies, as if the world past that mountain spine were a blank washed by sunlight. One missionary asked me to describe Apache raids. I told him I had seen hunger more fearsome than any raid. He smiled politely and returned to his lecture about the obligation to tame the continent. In the dining hall the students debated temperance and the virtues of the new railroads while the winter wind rattled the windows. I spoke when it seemed necessary and listened when it was not. Their quarrels felt small compared to the ones that lived in my bones.

Letters from Carlisle followed me west. Miss Burgess wrote to ask how I fared and to remind me that education was the surest answer to every problem the nation laid at our feet. Pratt sent a note congratulating me on advancing beyond his classrooms. His praise smelled of pride and ownership in equal measure. He reminded me that I carried the reputation of his great experiment. I slid his letter beneath the mattress and listened to it whisper each time I shifted in bed.

Not all the attention felt patronizing. There was a boy named Thomas who came from a farm outside Atchison. His hands were calloused from harness work, and he spoke with the slow drawl of the river towns. After class he lingered to ask about the desert. I described the mesas and the scent of creosote after rain. He listened without flinching, without asking if I missed the hunt or the warpath. He told me about the flood that had taken part of his father's cornfield the year before. We traded stories about land and loss until the stairwell went dark. Friendship built on shared labor felt different from the manufactured comradeship of the Carlisle dormitory. It rested on choice, not schedules.

In March the university held an elocution contest. President Craig insisted I participate. The assigned piece was a sermon on the triumph of civilization, written by a minister who had never set foot west of the Mississippi. I rewrote the ending in my room, replacing his final paragraphs with sentences about the cost of stripping a child of every sound he once knew. During the contest my voice carried through the chapel rafters, steady and measured. When I delivered the altered conclusion, a hush fell heavy enough to make the dust motes pause in the lamplight. The judges awarded me second place. Afterward, President Craig asked to see my notes. His jaw tightened when he realized what I had done. He reminded me that the university expected loyalty to the message. I told him I had given them the truth they claimed to prize.

Spring in Kansas arrived with thunderstorms that shook the window panes. Rain pooled in the ruts leading up the hill and the prairie burst into a green so vivid it hurt my eyes. Between classes I read in the library, tracing the lines of geography texts that reduced the Yavapai to a footnote. I copied the entries into my journal and added what the authors had forgotten: the names of the bands, the rivers we followed, the treaties broken before the ink dried. It was a narrow start, but it belonged to us.

Yet the longer I stayed, the more I sensed that Highland waited for me to become a trophy. The trustees spoke about sending me on speaking tours to raise funds for future Indian students. They wanted me to stand in pulpits and prove that their benevolence could polish any savage into a gentleman. They praised my penmanship and the posture Carlisle had drilled into me even as my marks slid toward the middle of the blackboard. They ignored the ache that grew heavier each time news arrived from Arizona Territory. Soldiers I had known at Fort Whipple wrote that unrest simmered near the reservation. One mentioned that the boys who had marched with me to San Carlos were now men with sons of their own, still waiting for the promise of return. The paper in my hands felt thin as the excuses that had escorted them away.

Money pressed its own arguments. The scholarship from the Indian Bureau covered tuition but not all of the costs of board. I could stretch my wages only so far. Each time I counted the coins in my trunk I remembered the families at San Carlos measuring meal rations with the same care. I burned extra lamp oil to study and still landed no higher than the middle column when marks were posted. To remain at Highland would mean debts to benefactors who believed they owned my future. To leave would be to step into uncertainty the Bureau called wilderness. I lay awake, listening to the rain on the shingles, whispering the promise I had made on the train east: I will remember.

By June the campus had emptied of most students. Wagon wheels etched muddy grooves down the hill, and the chapel bell rang only for Sunday meetings. I stayed on to tend the orchard and to wait for word about whether the Bureau would fund another year. Each evening I folded Pratt's letter and slid it back beneath the mattress, imagining the weight of decisions being made in offices far from the prairie. Thunderheads gathered at the edge of the sky. I knew a summons was coming. I did not yet know which world would claim me when it arrived.
