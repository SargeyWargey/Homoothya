# Chapter 21: December 28, 1872

The first shot cracked across the morning like thunder.

From my position on the rise, I saw the sentry at the cave entrance drop. Just... drop. One moment standing, looking out at the peaceful dawn. The next moment gone.

Then the world exploded.

Gunfire erupted from everywhere at once. From above the cave. From the slopes below. From positions I hadn't even known the soldiers occupied. The sound was overwhelming, echoing off the canyon walls, multiplying until it seemed like the whole earth was screaming.

I could see the cave entrance clearly from where I stood. Could see people stumbling out, confused, terrified. Could see them fall as bullets found them.

Could see them try to retreat back into the cave.

Into the trap.

The officer beside me said something coldly in English. I didn't understand the words but I understood the tone. Keep firing. Don't stop.

The gunfire continued. Relentless. The soldiers above the cave were firing straight down into the entrance. I could see the muzzle flashes. Could see people trying to run, trying to hide, trying to protect their children.

But it was too dark inside the cave to see faces. Too far to recognize individuals. Just shapes. Figures. People dying.

My people.

A woman ran from the cave entrance, something bundled in her arms. A child. A baby maybe.

She made it three steps before the bullets found her.

She fell forward, her body curling around whatever she carried. Protecting it with her last breath.

I couldn't see if it was my mother. Couldn't see if that was my sister.

But someone's mother had just died. Someone's sister.

And I had led the soldiers here.

One of the soldiers near us said something. He sounded sick.

But the shooting didn't stop. Couldn't stop. Had its own momentum now.

I sank to my knees, my hands over my ears, but I couldn't block out the sounds. The gunfire. The screams. The ricochets singing off stone.

And then a new sound. A deep grinding. Cracking.

Through eyes blurred with tears, I saw soldiers on the rim above the cave. They were prying at something. Pushing.

A boulder.

It teetered at the edge. Then fell.

It didn't fall straight down. It bounced off the cliff face, shattering into fragments. The pieces rained down on the cave entrance like deadly hail. I heard the impacts. Heard screaming that might have been my imagination or might have been real.

More boulders followed. The soldiers above had found an efficient method. Why waste bullets when gravity would do the work?

The rocks fell. Bounced. Shattered. Crushed anything below.

Anyone below.

"Make them stop," I begged in Yavapai. "Please. Make them stop. Please."

No one answered. The soldiers' faces were gray. But no one gave the order to cease fire.

Maybe they couldn't. Maybe this thing they'd started had to run its course. Had to burn itself out like wildfire, consuming everything before it died.

The gunfire began to slow. Not because the soldiers were stopping, but because there were no more targets. No more movement at the cave entrance. No more people trying to escape.

Just silence punctuated by occasional shots. Soldiers making sure.

And then even those stopped.

The silence that followed was worse than the noise had been.

Smoke drifted across the canyon. From guns. From fires started inside the cave—I could see smoke coming from the entrance.

The officer stood watching, his face hard. Then he nodded.

He said something in English. His voice was flat. Empty. Orders to send men in to count the dead. Secure the area.

I watched soldiers scramble down to the cave. Watched them disappear into that dark entrance where my family had died.

Where my mother had probably died.

Where my father had tried to protect everyone.

Where Grandmother had prayed.

Where everyone I'd ever loved had been slaughtered in a stone box with nowhere to run.

Because I'd led the soldiers here.

The soldiers began emerging from the cave. Some looked shaken. One stumbled away and vomited. Another sat down hard, his head in his hands.

The officer walked down toward the cave to inspect. When he returned, his uniform was dusty but his face showed satisfaction. A job completed.

I heard him report to his other officers. Numbers. All women, children, and old men. A few were still alive when they went in. The scouts finished them.

Finished them. Crushed their skulls with rifle butts and rocks, I would later learn. Making sure.

Making sure there were no survivors.

Except me.

I didn't remember falling. Didn't remember hitting the ground. But suddenly I was lying in the dirt, my face pressed against stone, and I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Couldn't do anything but feel the world ending.

A soldier pulled me up. Not roughly, but not gently either. Just doing his job.

Through one of the scouts, the officer said to take me back up to the mesa camp.

They put me on a horse. My hands weren't tied but they might as well have been. I had nowhere to go. No one to go to.

Everyone was dead.

As they led me away from the canyon, back toward the mesa camp, I looked back once.

Smoke still rose from the cave entrance. I'd heard numbers through the scouts' broken Yavapai. Over seventy bodies, they said.

Seventy souls. Men and women and children and elders.

All dead because an eight-year-old boy had whispered "cave" when a knife was at his throat.

All dead because I'd chosen life over honor.

When we reached the mesa camp, a white officer was waiting. I'd never seen him before—he must have stayed up here during the attack. He looked older than the others. The lines in his face were deep. His eyes tired.

He came over as they lifted me down from the horse. Looked at me for a long moment.

"It's done," he said quietly in English. More to himself than to me.

I said nothing. Had no words left.

Through the scouts, he told me: I would come with him. He would take responsibility for me. See me cared for. Educated. Given a chance.

A chance. At what? At forgetting? At becoming someone else?

At living with what I'd done?

I didn't answer. Just stood there, hollow and empty, while he made arrangements through the scouts.

As the sun set that day—December 28, 1872—painting the sky in colors Grandmother would have loved, I looked back toward the canyon one last time.

The canyon was just a dark line on the horizon. You wouldn't know anything terrible had happened there. Wouldn't know the world had ended in stone and gunfire and falling rocks.

But I knew. Would always know.

The sight of people falling at the cave entrance.

The sound of boulders crushing bone.

The ricochets singing off stone deep in the cave where it was too dark to see but not too dark to die.

The silence that followed.

And the knowledge that I had guided them there. Had brought death to my people. Had walked at the front of the column showing soldiers the way.

I was Hoomothya. The only survivor. The witness.

Trying to carry the unbearable weight of being the only one living to tell.

- Soldiers on the rim above pushed boulders down onto people at the cave entrance
- Approximately 120 soldiers and 100+ Pima and Maricopa auxiliaries participated
- Captain William H. Brown commanded the attack from a position near the canyon
- Captain James Burns remained on the mesa and never physically went to the cave site
- Captain Burns took custody of Mike after the massacre
- Survivors found alive in the cave were killed by the auxiliary scouts
- Mike was renamed "Mike Burns" and became Captain Burns's ward/adoptive son
- This massacre effectively ended Yavapai resistance in the region
