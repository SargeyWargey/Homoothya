# FULL CIRCLE

Carlos Montezuma and Mike Burns achieved remarkable things: securing Fort McDowell as permanent Yavapai land in 1903, documenting their people's history, and creating legal precedents that continue to benefit the Yavapai people today. Mike's manuscript eventually reached publication, forcing a reckoning with historical truth.

Yet both men died before seeing Mike's words published. Carlos in 1923, less than a month after retrieving bones from the Cave. Mike in 1934, after decades trying to get his testimony heard. Neither held the published book. Neither saw historians change their accounts based on his testimony.

More than 150 years after the Skeleton Cave Massacre, the Yavapai people continue fighting for recognition, resources, and respect.

Mike Burns wrote so that future generations would know the truth. That truth is not merely historical but present. It lives in ongoing Indigenous struggles for sovereignty, in fights to protect water and land, in efforts to preserve languages targeted for extinction, in the daily resistance of Indigenous people asserting their right to exist, to be heard, to control their own futures.

Mike's witness reminds us that genocide is not a single past event but an ongoing process requiring constant resistance. His testimony calls us to see through the line from Skeleton Cave to contemporary struggles, to understand that historical justice requires present action.

At the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell, three graves connect past and present:

Carlos Montezuma, buried in 1923, the physician and activist who fought for his people until tuberculosis claimed his body.

The mass grave of Skeleton Cave victims, reinterred in 1933, contains approximately 80 people who died on December 28, 1872.

Mike Burns, buried in 1934, the witness who spent his life making sure the world would know what happened.

The cemetery connects the cousins in death as they were connected in life, linking them to the ancestors they fought to honor. Yavapai people continue to visit, to remember, to carry forward the work of witness.

Mike's testimony is no longer silent. His words are published, studied, cited, and remembered.

But the work is not finished.

Mike Burns was the only one living to tell what happened to his people in 1872. But his witness has multiplied. Every person who reads his words, every historian who corrects the record, every student who learns the truth, every Yavapai person who carries forward his legacy becomes part of that witness.

The story does not end with publication. It continues in the ongoing struggle for justice, recognition, and the right to exist on ancestral land.
