# CHAPTER 9: THE PROMISE

## 1873-1875

The first time General Crook spoke the words I carried a pitcher of water taller than my forearm. The general stood in the parade ground at Camp Verde with officers clustered around him and Yavapai leaders gathered across the packed earth. I stayed near the doorway of the adjutant's office as Captain Burns had instructed. The air smelled of horses and damp canvas. Crook lifted his hands and told them they could live at Rio Verde as long as they lived. The interpreter voiced the promise in Yavapai. The wind pushed the words toward me before it carried them over the river. I watched shoulders loosen and heads bow. I believed him because the men beside him believed him while they listened.

After that day the parade ground grew quieter. Soldiers still drilled, but more of their energy moved toward the reservation across the river. Freight wagons rattled in and out with sacks of flour and barrels of coffee. Captain Burns kept ledgers detailing every pound issued. He showed me how to copy numbers into columns and how to sum them without smearing ink across the page. At night I stacked the ledgers on the edge of his desk so he could study the lists of wheat, barley, and corn harvested by the people who had surrendered. I did not cross the river to see their fields, yet the reports painted them almost clearly: rows of green shoots, irrigation ditches trimmed by careful hands, granaries filling. When officers praised the results, pride tugged at me. I swallowed it before anyone could see.

I carried covered dishes to meetings where agency officials explained ration allotments. They spoke of flour, sugar, beans, bacon, and fresh beef. They spoke of the need to keep order and maintain records. They did not speak of the dances and songs that drifted across the river at night, but I heard them anyway when I slipped outside to empty slop buckets. The music rode the water until taps sounded and I was expected back inside.

Sometimes Captain Burns sent me to the quartermaster to fetch cloth or medicines. The doctor kept bottles of tinctures lined up like soldiers. His name was Williams. He entered the post only rarely, yet everyone knew his handwriting. It slanted across requisitions for quinine, poultices, laudanum. When sickness rippled through the reservation in the second year, his name traveled faster than any medicine. Men arrived at the post with red-rimmed eyes and voices hoarse from grief. They said whole families lay still inside brush shelters. They said children burned with fever until dawn and no one could cool them. They said Dr. Williams had poisoned them. The accusation hung in the air like smoke. No officer answered it directly. They argued instead about clean water and proper sanitation. Their voices were tight with worry or anger or both. I stood in the doorway and tried to read whether the poison was on their hands or only in the distrust between them and the people outside the fence.

Death moved with relentless patience. Each time I ferried blankets or paper to the agency, someone else was missing from the group that once waited by the gate. I recognized mothers who had helped my own grandmother grind mesquite, cousins who had traded stories by firelight, men who had hunted alongside my father. They looked through me when I approached in Army clothes, yet grief softened their eyes for a moment. We shared that softness in silence. I was still a boy, still bound to the post, yet the loss carved lines inside me that matched the ones deepening in their faces.

One afternoon Captain Burns returned from the agency with his shoulders bowed. He removed his hat, set it on the table, and told me close to half the people at Rio Verde were gone. He said disease had done what bullets had not. He did not know how to reconcile that truth with the promise he had heard Crook swear. He asked for coffee even though the day was warm. I poured it without spilling and carried the cup to him. He thanked me. Neither of us spoke again that evening.

When the mail arrived from Prescott or Washington, I sorted envelopes by sender. Some held instructions about how to manage a population that was suddenly smaller. Some held requests from settlers who wanted Verde Valley land opened for purchase. Those letters were short and confident. They assumed the promise could be altered by ink. I slid them into the captain's inkwell tray and watched the pile grow.

I kept tallies for the laundress too. She knew exactly how many shirts and blankets belonged to which company. In March of 1874 she miscounted for the first time since I had known her. She explained it away as fatigue, but later she admitted she could not stop thinking about the burial parties leaving the reservation each morning. She had washed blankets stained by fever, and even the boiling water had not erased the smell. That night she knelt in the chapel and prayed for mercy on people she had only glimpsed from the path. I prayed beside her. The priest called us devout. I knew it was guilt.

The promise held even as death hollowed the camp. No troop movements suggested otherwise. The ration lists continued. Every week the quartermaster issued coffee and sugar because someone in Washington expected the population to remain orderly. Then a courier arrived in the winter of 1875 with orders sealed in wax. The courier's horse stumbled into the yard, sweat crusted along its neck. I brushed the animal while its rider slept off the journey. When Captain Burns broke the seal that night, his face went pale. He told me nothing, yet he stayed awake until dawn writing reports. The next afternoon wagons appeared on the parade ground, and soldiers began to load them with tools and provisions. I understood what was happening before the officers announced it. The promise had lasted two years. That was the measure of "as long as they lived."

I did not walk in the fields of Rio Verde during that time, but I walked through their memory often after Highland. When I was a grown man returning from Kansas with calloused hands and a head full of English words, I sought out families who had survived the disease. They told me how the air smelled sweet with orange blossoms before the sickness came. They described the taste of wheat they had grown themselves and the day the ration beef turned sour in their mouths. They remembered the doctor moving from shelter to shelter with bottles that offered no relief. They said Crook's promise echoed like a cruel joke every time someone died in the night. As they spoke, I heard again the clink of Captain Burns's inkwell, the scratch of his pen as he tried to reconcile casualty numbers with the assurances he had written in earlier letters. Their grief matched the fragments I had gathered long before, and the two halves of the story locked together like the teeth of a trap.

I record these memories now so my grandchildren will know that trust was not lost in a single instant. It frayed quietly while wheat sprouted and while officials praised the farmers they intended to displace. The promise failed before anyone marched. It failed when disease thinned the lodges and the doctor defended himself with paper instead of healing. It failed each time a settler's letter weighed more than the lives counted in my ledgers. By the time orders arrived to abandon Rio Verde, the foundation had already been dug out from beneath us. All that remained was to watch the roof collapse.
