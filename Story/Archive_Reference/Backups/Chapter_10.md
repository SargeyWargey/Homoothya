# CHAPTER 10: GOOD-BYE MY HOMELAND

## February 1875

The day the column formed, frost clung to the shaded side of the adobe wall. Soldiers moved quietly, the way men move when they know a promise has cracked and they do not wish to hear it shatter again. Captain Burns told me to stay near the commissary. I obeyed long enough to watch wagons loaded with sacks of flour, barrels of salt pork, and coils of rope. Then I slipped along the fence line until I could see the people gathered beyond the parade ground. Families stood with bundles tied in blankets. Some carried clay pots, some carried tools, all carried the weight of disbelief. Two winters earlier they had been told they could remain in the Verde Valley as long as they lived. Now an officer I did not know repeated the words of a new order: they would go to San Carlos. If they behaved, they could return in five to seven years. The second promise sounded thin even as he spoke it.

I recognized faces in the crowd. Hashduba held her grandchildren close, their cheeks streaked with tears. Men who had surrendered their weapons after Skeleton Cave now leaned on walking sticks, bodies weakened by sickness and grief yet ready to march if it meant staying together. Women balanced cradleboards on their backs. The smell of cedar bundles, the sharp tang of tanned hides, and the sweet smoke of last-minute fires drifted toward me. The soldiers smelled of oil and gunpowder. I stood between those scents and felt pulled in both directions.

When the column moved out, no wagons carried people. Wagons held supplies and weapons. The people walked. Snowmelt slid down from the mountains and turned the road into a ribbon of mud. Captain Burns rode near the front. He waved me forward and told me to ride behind him. Lieutenant Bishop, newly assigned to Camp Verde, nodded permission. I climbed into the saddle of a mule usually reserved for errands. The animal's ears twitched with every shout that rose from the line. I kept my eyes on the backs of the soldiers ahead of me, but every few steps I turned to mark who walked alongside. Mothers whispered comfort in Yavapai. Children stumbled in shoes that did not fit. Elderly men leaned on younger relatives who refused to let go.

We crossed the Verde River before noon. The water was cold enough to numb feet within seconds. Soldiers on horseback pushed forward through the current while families linked arms to steady one another. The river swelled against their legs. I saw a girl stumble and vanish beneath the surface. Her mother screamed. A scout swung down from his horse and dragged the girl back into the shallows. She coughed up water and clung to her mother's waist. The officers called for faster movement. Their orders echoed off the canyon walls and scattered the wails into fragments.

The march stretched into a rhythm of dawn fires, hurried meals, long hours of walking, and restless sleep beneath army blankets. Rations dwindled faster than expected. Flour sacks tore open, and precious handfuls of grain spilled into the dust. Beef issued at the start turned sour. Soldiers tightened their belts but still had coffee each morning. The people who walked beside us chewed parched corn saved from their own stores. When a boy of five collapsed near the tenth camp, his father asked an officer for a place in a wagon. The officer refused. There was no wagon space for the living.

On the twelfth day we reached the East Verde River. Tension had simmered for miles between Tonto families and the Apache Mojaves and Yumas who walked beside them. Old grievances rubbed raw under hunger and fatigue. As we halted to refill canteens, a shout cracked through the air. Someone struck first. I never learned who. The fight surged like wildfire. Men who had carried relatives moments before now raised knives and clubs. Women screamed. Soldiers tried to force separation, but the riverbank channeled the violence into a narrow corridor. I saw Al Sieber, the chief of scouts, ride straight into the fray, shouting orders in English and Yavapai. A rifle flashed. Sieber grabbed his stomach and fell from the saddle. Blood soaked his shirt. He survived, but the wound twisted his stride for the rest of his life. By the time officers regained control, thirty or more Tontos lay dead on the rocks. The survivors gathered their bodies in silence. We marched again before the earth could cool.

Each night I lay close to the Army fire, the better to hear orders relayed for the next day. Each night my thoughts walked among the campfires of the people being driven from their homeland. I wanted to crouch beside them and share the food hidden in my saddlebag, but soldiers watched me as if waiting to see where my loyalty rested. I stared into the flames until sleep finally dragged me under. Dreams carried me to the canyon I had led the soldiers to and to the green valley we now left behind. In both places, echoing cries chased me while I ran without finding shelter.

Some mornings we rose to sleet that stung skin raw. Other mornings the sun glared off wet ground and blinded horses. Small children learned to walk in step with soldiers because a misstep could bring a rifle butt against their shoulders. Elders wrapped themselves in every scrap of cloth they owned. I heard prayers whispered for mountains, rivers, and the spirits of ancestors who had promised protection. The prayers carried the names of landmarks that lived in my bones as surely as any that belonged to the Army. The officers around me complained about the cold and the delay. The people around them mourned every mile that separated them from the Verde.

The closer we drew to San Carlos, the more the land flattened. The mountains that framed the Verde Valley shrank behind us. Word spread through the ranks that the reservation held other Apache bands who spoke different dialects and did not welcome newcomers. No one cheered when the Gila River finally came into view. The people walked across the boundary in silence. An official from the Indian Bureau stood waiting with a ledger. He counted heads as if the march had been an inventory exercise. He wrote down numbers while families searched for space to build shelters among strangers. When the last tally mark was made, the officer who had announced Crook's second promise declared the journey complete. He did not mention the dead left along the road or the years that would stretch far beyond the seven he had offered. I dismounted and stood on the dry ground of San Carlos. The wind carried grit and the faint smell of unfamiliar cook fires. I whispered farewell to the water, trees, and rocks of the Verde. I knew I might never see them again except in memory.

Years later, when I returned from Highland and sought out the people who had endured the march, they told me stories that matched what I had witnessed from the saddle. They spoke of shoes that fell apart within days, of children carried on shoulders until fathers collapsed, of elders buried in shallow graves because the march could not pause long enough for proper rites. They told me the second promise had been a lie meant to quiet them. None of them ever saw the Army escort arrive to lead them home. They found their way back to the Verde only decades later, walking by choice this time, carrying the memories of those who had not survived.

If I write the words good-bye my homeland now, it is because I felt the land pulled from beneath my feet even while I sat a horse and wore Army clothes. The officers called me by the name Burns. The people in the column looked past me as though the name belonged to someone else. The truth lived in the ache that settled under my ribs with every mile. The land carried the bones of my ancestors. Leaving it felt like leaving them unguarded. I carried that ache into every year that followed, and it guides my hand as I set these memories on the page so the promise and its betrayal will not be forgotten.
