# PROLOGUE (Version 2)

### 1920
### Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona

The blank pages stare at me like the past waiting to swallow me whole.

I sit at my table as the afternoon light slants through the window, turning the dust in the air to gold. Outside, the desert stretches toward the Salt River, the same river that runs through the canyon where I was born. The river still runs. But the world it flows through is not the one I knew.

My hands rest on either side of the paper. Weathered hands. Scarred knuckles. Fingers that have held a rifle and signed my name at the polling place, the first of our people to do so. They have held graphite a hundred times, trying to find the first word.

My cousin Carlos has spent his life fighting with newspapers and speeches, making the White People listen to what they have done to us. He has the fire, the way with words that make crowds stop and hear. I do not have that gift. I have only this: my witness. The weight of carrying a story when so many who lived it cannot speak.

There are things I have seen that others did not survive to tell. Moments when the world ended while the sun still shone. I carry them not because I am strong, but because I am here.

The White People have written their version of what happened. They have called it warfare, necessity, the price of peace. But I was there. I remember the taste of roasted agave shared around fires where the old ones told stories. I remember my mother's voice. I remember laughter and the certainty that I belonged to a people who belonged to this land.

I remember the sound of gunfire echoing off stone.

They gave me a new name that day. A new language. They tried to make me forget I was Yavapai. But memory does not die so easily.

So I will write in the language they taught me, because it is the language they will read. I will use their words to tell them what their words cannot hide. I will speak for the ones who fell silent.

My name is Mike Burns. I am the one who survived. I am the one who remembers.

Carlos showed me that our voices matter. That our stories can reach beyond the reservations where they have tried to bury us. That the White People need to hear what they have done, not from their generals and their historians, but from us. From the ones who bled.

So I will write.

The only one living to tell.
