# Mike Burns Manuscript & APCRP Research Synthesis

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Mike Burns's own testimony (from "Only One Living To Tell") is the PRIMARY and AUTHORITATIVE source. Where contradictions exist with secondary sources (APCRP), Mike Burns's version takes precedence.

**Sources Analyzed:**
1. **PRIMARY SOURCE (AUTHORITATIVE)**: `/Manuscripts/Only_One_Living_To_Tell_Mike_Burns.md` - Mike Burns's first-person testimony
2. **SECONDARY SOURCE**: `/Manuscripts/NewResearch/apcrp.md` - American Pioneer & Cemetery Research Project article on Skeleton Cave Massacre

## SECTION 1: EVENTS

### Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)

**Mike Burns's Account (AUTHORITATIVE):**
- Date: December 28, 1872
- Mike was captured December 22, 1872 (6 days before massacre)
- Location: Cave on north side of Salt River at mouth of Fish Creek
- Victims: ~225 souls (men, women, children) according to Mike
- Mike's family killed: father, grandfather, little brother, baby sister, aunt with 5 children, uncle
- Chief Delshe killed
- Method: Soldiers shot volleys behind big boulders so bullets ricocheted off cave walls
- "The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans"
- One survivor: Mike's brother-in-law, last to be killed, shot through bowels with gun bent nearly double
- Pima and Maricopa scouts rushed in after, crushed heads of wounded with rocks
- Some women and children saved by Apache scouts who gave them to soldiers
- One wounded woman left with food/water, later killed by Pimas when soldiers left
- **Mike is "the only one living to tell"**

**APCRP Account (SECONDARY):**
- Same date: December 28, 1872
- Led by Captain William H. Brown with 130 troopers from 5th US Cavalry + 30 Apache scouts
- Various casualty counts: 54 dead/20 captured (National Register), 76 dead/18 mortally wounded/35 prisoners (Arizona Highways 1959), 75 dead (National Park Service)
- 6 young women escaped (away gathering mescal before attack)
- Method: ricochet bullets off cave ceiling
- Death chant described
- 4-year-old boy shot in skull, dragged to safety by scout Nantaje
- One Pima scout killed, one wounded (only attacking force casualties)

**CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS:**
- **Casualty numbers differ**: Mike says ~225; APCRP sources say 54-76
- **MIKE BURNS VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE** - he was eyewitness, forced to witness
- Secondary sources may have undercounted or Mike's memory includes total band size
- Both agree on method (ricochet bullets), brutality, Pima/Maricopa violence against survivors

**Key Quotes from Mike Burns:**
> "The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans. The war songs ceased."

> "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

> "In all history no civilized race has murdered another as the American soldiers did my people in the year 1872."

## SECTION 7: KEY QUOTES FOR NOVEL (Mike's Voice)

### On the Massacre

> "The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans. The war songs ceased."

> "I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people."

> "In all history no civilized race has murdered another as the American soldiers did my people in the year 1872. They slaughtered men, women, and children without mercy, as if they were not human."

> "I saw dead men and women lying around in all shapes, horrid to look on. I saw where my grandpa lay; I saw at a distance a body that was in a little rock hole, headfirst, and that was the old man."

> "What would I do? Should I give myself up to the Pimas and Maricopas to be killed there with my family? Should I forget those awful deeds against my people and take on a new and manly courage, resolve to be a different man and hope for a better future?"

### On Being Captured

> "I was only a few miles away from them. How I got through that freezing night is a miracle."

> "They pulled me over rocks and bushes. The men didn't care whether I got hurt or not."

> "It is a mysterious thing, the fact that I am alive to tell how I was saved, while every last one of my tribe was killed."

### On Identity

> "I have no home, sir. My home is just where I make my bed."

> "I am not ashamed to say that I am an Indian. I am more proud than ever to be an Indian."

> "I am going to tell the White People that they have heard only one side of the stories about how bad the Apaches were to the whites. But the Apaches were forced to be so and they tried to protect themselves, their homes and their land. And who would not do the same thing?"

### On Loss and Memory

> "Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land."

> "Anyone who has had to live by himself in the world knows what it is like to have no one to help when he is in need."

> "I have come to the conclusion that the mind of man changes, but the country never changes."

### On Broken Promises

> "General Crook had promised the Apache Yumas that when the Yavapai were tamed they could return to Date Creek, their old home, which would belong to them as long as they lived. This was only a verbal agreement, and the Indians had done as they said they would and carried out their part of it, even acting as scouts and guides for the soldiers and fighting their own people. Now General Crook wanted them all to move over to San Carlos... His fine promises, however, were never carried out."

### On Being Witness

> "I often wish that I could go back to that little stream." [about finding gold]

> "I traveled across the Laramie River bottom for many miles in dark night, a place full of the skeletons of whites and Indians... I went over all these human bones, but I heard nothing from them all those nights of traveling. There was even a place where soldiers had slaughtered some Indians who made no attempt to fight back. It is foolish to believe that parts of dead persons can come back to life enough to harm anyone."

## SECTION 10: CRITICAL THEMES FOR NOVEL

### Survival and Witness

- "The only one living to tell"
- Burden of being sole survivor
- Obligation to remember and testify
- Witness as resistance to erasure

### Identity and Displacement

- Hoomothya → Mickie → Mike Burns
- Between two worlds, belonging to neither
- "I have no home, sir. My home is just where I make my bed"
- Proud to be Indian despite pressures to assimilate

### Broken Promises

- Crook's promise: "as long as they lived"
- Reality: 2 years then forced removal
- Pattern of broken treaties
- Education promises vs. Christian community failures

### Loss and Memory

- Individual losses: mother, father, siblings, grandfather, aunt, cousins
- Collective loss: homeland, way of life, language
- Power of memory to preserve
- Writing as act of remembrance

### Moral Complexity

- Scout service: helping hunt own people
- Education: tool of assimilation vs. tool of testimony
- Christianity: genuine faith vs. empty promises
- Survival: adaptation vs. preservation
