## Research Priorities for Novel Development

1. **Captain Burns vs. Captain Brown Contradiction**:
   - Who commanded Skeleton Cave operation?
   - Were both present?

   - **Resolution critical for novel accuracy**

2. **Mike's Death Date Verification**:
   - APCRP says November 16, 1934
   - Mike's manuscript context suggests November 26, 1934
   - Check Fort McDowell cemetery records
   - Check death certificate if available

3. **Chief Delshe Verification**:
   - Mike says killed at Skeleton Cave
   - Secondary sources say survived, surrendered later
   - Possible two different chiefs with similar names?
   - Check Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation oral traditions
   - **Mike's version is authoritative as eyewitness**

4. **Yavapai Language Consultation**:
   - Place names: Weegajochehaw, Wee-git-a-sour-ha, Ah-haw-gith-e-la
   - Personal names: Hoomothya meaning, other characters
   - Cultural practices mentioned
   - **MUST consult with Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation**

## File Organization Reminder

**When creating new files, maintain this structure**:

- **Characters/** → All character profiles (Mike, Burns, Bishop, Thomas, Delshe, Bourke, etc.)
- **Events/** → Historical events and periods (Massacre, March of Tears, Rio Verde, etc.)
- **Places/** → Geographic locations (Four Peaks, Superstition Mtns, San Carlos, etc.)
- **Research/Cultural/** → Yavapai cultural research
- **Research/Historical/** → Historical analysis and context
- **Research/Story_Development/** → Novel development notes, outlines, synthesis
- **Story/Drafts/** → Chapter drafts when writing begins
- **Story/Scenes/** → Individual scene experiments
- **Story/Outlines/** → Act and chapter outlines

---

## Writing Philosophy Reminder (From CLAUDE.md)

**This is a NOVEL, not a research paper**:
- Research serves the story; facts ground the emotion
- Goal: deep emotional connection with Mike and Yavapai people
- Make readers FEEL Mike's journey
- Immersive sensory details
- Rich character development
- Compelling dramatic narrative
- Intimate first-person voice

**Quality Standards**:
- Show, don't tell
- Specific over general
- Sensory immersion (smell/taste/sound/feel)
- Emotional subtext
- Trust readers - don't over-explain
- **Minimize em-dashes** throughout entire novel
- Let silence and white space speak

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Explaining instead of showing
- Historical voice ("It was the year 1872...")
- Cultural content without verification
- Facts drowning emotion
- Stereotypes or romanticization
- Telling readers how to feel

---

## Success Metrics

**Benchmark Question**:
Could you hand this to someone who's never heard of Mike Burns, and would they:
1. Be unable to put it down?
2. Feel genuine grief, hope, rage, connection?
3. See Mike as a real person they care about?
4. Understand something profound about survival, identity, witness?
5. Want to learn more about the real Mike Burns and Yavapai people?

**Ultimate Success**:
A manuscript Mike Burns himself would recognize as true to his life and worthy of his witness—told as a story that makes people FEEL what it meant to be him.
