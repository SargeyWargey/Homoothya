## SYNTHESIS: THE EMOTIONAL JOURNEY

### Three-Act Emotional Arc
**ACT I**: INNOCENCE → ANNIHILATION (love → loss)
**ACT II**: SURVIVAL → COMPROMISE (adaptation → complicity)

2. **Feel the horror** of massacre (through Mike's traumatized eyes)
3. **Understand the complexity** of survival (Burns, Carlisle, scouts - moral impossibility)
4. **Witness the mission** crystallize (from survivor to storyteller)
5. **Honor the persistence** despite rejection (writing as sacred duty)
6. **Celebrate the vindication** posthumous but real (truth survives)

### For Writing the Novel
