## Usage Guidelines for Novel

### Best Practices

**When to use Yavapai words:**
- When Mike (as child Hoomothya) is in Yavapai community
- For place names and sacred sites
- For names of people and beings
- To show language loss and reclamation across Mike's life
- To honor the language and its speakers

**When to provide English translation:**
- First use of any Yavapai word (in dialogue or narrative)
- When non-Yavapai characters hear the words
- When context doesn't make meaning clear
- In a way that feels natural, not like a vocabulary lesson

**How to show language loss:**
- Mike speaking Yavapai fluently as child
- Losing words at Carlisle (punishment for speaking)
- Struggling to remember words as adult
- Relearning from Chehata's family
- The pain of forgotten words

**Respectful representation:**
- Never treat language as exotic decoration
- Show living language connected to real people
- Acknowledge language endangerment
- Credit sources and consultants
- Use language to serve story and character

### Examples of Natural Integration

**Instead of**: "Mother said 'Hoomothya' which means 'Wet Nose' in Yavapai."

**Try**: "My mother called me Hoomothya—Wet Nose—because of how I'd woken from a dream as an infant, my face damp from crying."

**Instead of**: "He looked at the mountain called Weegajochehaw."

**Try**: "He looked up at Weegajochehaw, the mountain that has been chopped up, its four peaks stark against the sky."

## Notes for Author

### Remember

1. **These are real words from a living language** spoken by fewer than 100 people. Treat them with respect.

2. **Every Yavapai word in the novel must be verified** by Yavapai language consultants before publication.

3. **The goal is not authenticity for its own sake** but to honor Mike Burns's bilingual reality and the Yavapai people's linguistic heritage.

4. **Language is connected to identity**: Mike's loss of Yavapai language = loss of self. His relearning = reclamation of identity.

5. **Silence can speak volumes**: Sometimes it's more powerful to show Mike reaching for a word and finding it gone than to fill the page with vocabulary.

6. **Less can be more**: A few carefully chosen Yavapai words, properly contextualized, can evoke an entire worldview. Don't overload the reader.

7. **The manuscript is Mike's act of witness**: In English (the colonizer's language), but carrying Yavapai truth. That tension matters.

### Future Research Tasks

- [ ] Contact Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation for language consultation
- [ ] Request access to Wipukpa-Tolkapaya dictionary for verification
- [ ] Interview Yavapai elders (if appropriate and welcomed)
- [ ] Attend language revitalization workshops if available to public
- [ ] Consult with academic linguists specializing in Yavapai
- [ ] Create pronunciation guide for audiobook readers
- [ ] Document all consultations for author's note and acknowledgments
