Detailed Summary
This autobiography tells the harrowing story of Mike Burns (Hoomothya - "Wet Nose"), a Kwevkepaya (Yavapai) man who survived the Skeleton Cave Massacre of December 1872 as a young boy and lived between two worlds for the rest of his life.
The Skeleton Cave Massacre (1872)
The tragedy began when Army scouts—derisively called "Tonto Apaches" (tonto meaning "fool" in Spanish)—captured the terrified 8-10 year old boy and forced him to reveal his family's location. About 100 Kwevkepayas were sheltering under a rock overhang above the Salt River when approximately 120 soldiers, accompanied by over 100 Pima (Akimel O'odham) and Maricopa auxiliaries, attacked. Captain James Burns ordered boulders rolled down from above while soldiers fired from the roof of the cave. When the shooting stopped, the Akimel O'odham advanced and crushed skulls with rifle butts and rocks. Seventy-six Kwevkepayas died, including Mike's father, young siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandfather. His mother had been killed by soldiers around 1869. Officer John Gregory Bourke called it "the most signal blow ever received by the Apaches in Arizona," though it's now properly known as the Skeleton Cave Massacre—a one-sided slaughter where only one attacker died.
Life with the Army (1872-1886)
Captain James Burns took the orphaned boy into his household as something between a ward and servant. The boy—whom Burns named Michael Burns—mucked stables, cleaned houses, shined boots, and apparently spied on Yavapais interned at Fort Whipple. When Captain Burns fell ill and left for Washington, Mike became the charge of Captain Hall S. Bishop, who would become like a father to him.
For the next several years, Mike and Bishop crossed the western frontier together, fighting various Indian nations. Mike served as an Army scout and lived in two worlds while belonging to neither. The whites he served never saw him as anything other than an Indian, while he had only tenuous contact with his own people for many years.
