## SCENES OF TRAUMA & LOSS (Act I - Massacre & Aftermath)

- **False peace**: Morning routines in cave, maybe playing with cousin, mother preparing food

- **Confusion**: What's happening? Why are people screaming? Where's mother?

**DURING (Fragments, Dissociation):**
- **Sensory overload**: Gunfire echoing in cave (deafening), smoke, screaming, chaos
- **Dissociation**: Pieces only - a face, a hand, blood on stone - not coherent narrative
- **Physical**: Can't move, paralyzed, someone falling on him?, dragged somewhere?, hiding?
- **Sound**: Guns, ricochets, screams, his own breathing, then silence
- **Smell**: Gunpowder, copper (blood), dust, smoke
- **NOT graphic violence**: His perception, his confusion, what he can't process, gaps in memory

**AFTER (Immediate Aftermath):**
- **Silence**: Terrible silence after noise, ringing ears
- **Calling**: "Mother?" whispered, then louder, then screaming
- **Searching**: Crawling over... don't describe in detail, but he's looking for mother
- **Finding**: Her face, eyes open, not answering - realization
- **Shock**: Can't cry, can't scream anymore, just empty, alone
- **Survival**: Somehow still alive among the dead, why?, guilt beginning

- **Cultural shock**: First close contact with white man, can't understand language, complete alien
- **Physical**: Struggling, overpowered, bound?, carried away from family
- **Emotional**: Terror absolute, crying for mother, certain he'll die

**CAPTIVITY (6 Days):**
- **With Captain Burns**: Learning his name later, doesn't know yet
- **Waiting**: Knowing family in cave, knowing soldiers planning, can't warn them
- **Food**: White man food (foreign, wrong), maybe refusing to eat, grief/fear stealing appetite
- **Attempts to communicate?**: Neither speaks other's language, gestures, confusion
- **Psychological torture**: Knowing something bad coming, helpless to stop it

**FORCED RETURN TO CAVE:**
- **Ultimate betrayal**: Made to guide back to cave? Or forced to return with them?
- **Conflicting accounts**: Some say he guided willingly (untrue), some say forced
- **Horror**: Leading them to family's hiding place, even if forced
- **Later guilt**: Did I cause this? Did my capture doom them? Survivor's guilt rooted here

### After Massacre - Living with the Killer

**IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH (Still at Cave?):**
- **Burns decides to adopt**: "I'll take this one." In white language Hoomothya doesn't understand
- **No choice**: Carried away from massacre site, from dead family, from everything
- **First days**: Shock, silence, not eating?, not speaking, trauma response
- **Name change**: "Hoomothya" → "Mike Burns" - identity stripped immediately

**EARLY ADOPTION PERIOD:**

- **Complicated feelings**: Gratitude for survival + hatred for killing + need for protection = impossible emotions

**TRANSFORMATION CEREMONY:**
- **Setting**: Carlisle arrival, institutional processing

- **Emotional**: Violation, shame forced on him, seeing self becoming stranger, resistance dying

### Daily Life at Carlisle

**CLASSROOM:**
- **Setting**: Rigid rows, English only, incomprehensible lessons
- **Contrast Yavapai learning**: Not experiential, not communal, not loving - solitary, punitive, meaningless
- **Language suppression**: Punishment for Yavapai words, but Yavapai is how he thinks

- **Resistance & capitulation**: How long can he resist? When does survival become complicity?

**DORMITORY:**
- **Setting**: Night, boys whispering in forbidden languages, homesickness thick

- **Secret culture**: Whispered languages, stories told when supervisors gone, underground resistance
- **Emotional**: Loneliness in crowd, kinship with other displaced, grief for home, small rebellions as survival

**DINING HALL:**
- **Contrast**: Individual plates (not communal pot), grace in English (not Yavapai prayer), scheduled (not when hungry)
- **Food**: Institutional, no mesquite, no mescal, no taste of home
- **Discipline**: Eat when told, how told, white manners, body controlled
- **Memory**: Every meal reminds of family gathered, mother's cooking, grandmother's blessing - grief with every bite

---

## SCENES OF MORAL COMPROMISE (Act II - Scout Service)

### Decision to Enlist

**INTERNAL CONFLICT:**
- **Age ~20 (July 1885)**: Carlisle complete, options limited, what now?
- **Reasoning**: Army pays, knows wilderness, can return to Arizona, maybe find surviving Yavapai
- **Justification**: "I'll track, not kill." "Just surviving." "What else can I do?"
- **Doubt**: Uncle's voice in memory: Taught him tracking to feed family, not hunt own people
- **Decision**: Enlisting despite doubt, compromising for survival, first step down dark path

### Scout Service - Using Sacred Knowledge Against People

**TRACKING OTHER NATIVES:**
- **Setting**: Arizona wilderness, hunting Apache (his allies!), white soldiers depending on his skill
- **Cultural knowledge weaponized**: Knows seasonal camps, water sources, migration routes - uses against them
- **Internal dialogue**: "They're not my band." "I have to survive." "Maybe they'll escape." - rationalizations failing
- **Sensory**: Finding sign he was taught to read by uncle, leading soldiers to people hiding like his family hid
- **Emotional**: Guilt crushing, self-hatred, what would mother think?, betrayal of everything taught

**RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOLDIERS:**
- **Othering**: Not quite soldier, not quite prisoner, "useful Indian," respected for skill but not as equal
- **Prejudice & occasional friendship**: Some soldiers hate him, some curious, rare ones kind
- **Language**: English now fluent, Yavapai spoken only to self in private, linguistic split = identity split
- **Belonging nowhere**: Not white, not traditionally Yavapai anymore, not even comfortably Apache - liminal hell

**WITNESSING PURSUIT OF OTHERS:**
- **Seeing families flee**: Reminds him of his childhood fleeing, but now he's on other side
- **When they're caught**: Does he look away? Feel relief not him? Guilt for his role?
- **Knowing the fear**: He knows exactly what those Apache children feel - he felt it once

- **Sensory**: Mountains purple-blue on horizon, recognition visceral, tears unexpected
- **Spiritual**: Mountain Spirits still there, waited for him, land remembers him
- **Emotional**: Grief for lost years, relief (home exists), belonging reawakening, but also alienation (he's different now)

**FORT MCDOWELL ARRIVAL:**
- **Setting**: Reservation, Yavapai-Apache community, survivors gathered
- **Reception**: How do they see him? Carlisle product? Returned son? Scout betrayer?
- **Language**: Hearing Yavapai again, speaking it (rusty?), words of childhood in adult mouth
- **Reconnection**: Finding distant relatives? People who knew family? Fragments of past life?
- **Emotional**: Joy of return + pain of what's lost + uncertainty of acceptance

### Building New Life

**ATTEMPTING NORMALCY:**
- **Marriage**: Finding companionship, creating new family to replace lost one
- **Reservation life**: Neither traditional nor white, hybrid existence, making do
- **Community role**: What's his place? Educated, English-speaking, but Yavapai at heart
- **Spiritual return**: Prayers in Yavapai again, seeing sacred sites, ceremonies (if still practiced)

**RECOGNIZING NEED TO WRITE:**
- **Trigger**: Seeing history being forgotten? Children not knowing? Lies being told?
- **Decision**: Must record truth, must witness, only one left who can
- **Language choice**: English (only way to be read), but Yavapai truth - another compromise but necessary
- **Purpose emerging**: This is why he survived - to tell

- **Sensory**: Old hands shaking, paper and pencil, silence except his breathing, heat/cold of seasons
- **Physical**: Body failing, memory sharp, racing to finish before death
- **Emotional**: Urgency, resignation (no publisher wants it), determination (truth matters anyway)

**WRESTLING WITH WORDS:**
- **What to include**: How to describe massacre? How much horror? How to make them understand?
- **What to leave out**: Sacred things, private grief, what's not for white eyes?
- **Voice**: Writing in English but thinking in Yavapai, translation always imperfect
- **Audience**: Who will read this? Anyone? Does it matter?

**INTERLUDE MOMENTS:**
- **Stopping to remember**: Closing eyes, seeing mother's face, hearing grandmother's voice, feeling it all again
- **Questioning**: Will this work? Can words carry this? Am I betraying or honoring?
- **Continuing**: Picking up pencil again, despite doubt, because it's all he can do
- **Ghosts**: Family in the room with him?, ancestors watching?, writing not alone?

### Final Days & Death

**MANUSCRIPT COMPLETION:**
- **Last words written**: "I am the only one living to tell..."
- **Setting it aside**: Done, whatever it is, it's done
- **Resignation**: Will likely die unpublished, but truth exists now on paper

**DEATH SCENE (November 26, 1934):**
- **Setting**: Fort McDowell, surrounded by community? Alone?
- **Final thoughts**: Seeing family again soon?, relief (witness borne)?, fear (was it enough)?
- **Last sight**: Four Peaks out window?, sacred mountains still there when he's gone?
- **Peace or regret**: Did he do enough? Honor them enough? Or peace that he tried?

**EPILOGUE - BEYOND DEATH:**
- **Manuscript in archives**: Gathering dust, decades passing, 2010 approaching
- **Discovery**: Someone finding it, reading it, understanding importance
- **Publication (2010/2012)**: 76+ years after death, his voice finally heard
- **Vindication**: He was right to write, right to witness, truth endures
- **Legacy**: Children reading, learning, knowing Hoomothya existed, knowing Yavapai people matter
- **Final image**: Four Peaks still standing, Mountain Spirits still there, witness endures

## DIALOGUE KEYS

### Yavapai Speech (When Writing Yavapai Characters):

- **Indirect**: Respect shown through oblique speech, not confrontation
- **Sparse**: Action over words, teaching through doing

### White Characters (Captain Burns, Carlisle Staff, etc.):
- **Commands**: Authoritative, expecting obedience

- **Othering**: Referring to Natives as "they," "these people," dehumanizing language
- **Institutional**: Policy language, religious language, progress rhetoric

### Mike's Voice Evolution:
- **Child (Act I)**: Yavapai thought, simple, sensory, present-focused
- **Carlisle (Act II)**: English words, Yavapai heart, internal conflict in language itself
- **Adult (Act III)**: English fluent but Yavapai underneath, code-switching, translation always happening
- **Writing (1934)**: English on page, but reaching for Yavapai concepts, explaining one culture to another

## USAGE NOTES

**This guide is a tool, not a script:**
- Use to spark scenes, not dictate them
- Combine elements, don't use all at once (overwhelming)
- Let character and story need determine what sensory details matter
- Always prioritize emotional truth over cultural accuracy performance

**Cultural consultation essential before finalizing scenes involving:**
- Sacred practices, spiritual beings, ceremonies
- Family relationships and protocols (especially grief/mourning)
- Language use (get actual Yavapai words/phrases from consultants)
- What can be shared publicly vs. kept private

**Remember the purpose:**
- Readers should FEEL Mike's journey, not just know facts
- Every cultural detail serves story, reveals character, builds emotion
- Immersion ≠ anthropological report; it's selective, focused, dramatic
- Mike's witness honored through craft, not just information dump
