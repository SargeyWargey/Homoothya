## CRITICAL CONTRADICTIONS TO RESOLVE

### 1. Timeline of Pilgrimages to Skeleton Cave

**CONFLICT**: Multiple sources provide different dates and details:

- **Trip to Cave source** states: January 1923 pilgrimage with Carlos Montezuma, Mike Burns, John Williams, George and Charles Dickens
- **Trip to Cave source** states: 1925 second trip by Mike Burns with Maricopa County sheriff
- **Outline fiction (Chapter 24)** states: January 1923 pilgrimage with Carlos only (Mike and Carlos alone)
- **Outline fiction (Chapter 27)** states: Summer 1923 Mike traveled alone after Carlos's death

**QUESTIONS**:
- [x] Who accompanied Mike on the second trip? (John Williams, Dickens brothers, or alone?) **The 1925 trip included a Maricopa County sheriff and other Yavapai individuals.**
- [ ] Did Mike make a SECOND solo trip in summer 1923 after Carlos died (Jan 31, 1923)? **No evidence found.**

- [x] Which trips actually happened and which are fictional elements? **The 1925 trip is confirmed.**

**FINDINGS**:
- A 1925 trip to Skeleton Cave is confirmed. Mike Burns, a Maricopa County sheriff, and other Yavapai individuals collected remains and reburied them at Fort McDowell cemetery.
- The January 1923 pilgrimage with Carlos Montezuma is not clearly confirmed in the initial web search. More research in the specific archives is needed.

**RESEARCH NEEDED**:
- John Williams oral testimony (1975, via Sigrid Khera) - original transcript
- Braatz, Timothy. *Surviving Conquest: A History of the Yavapai Peoples* - specific pages
- Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation historical records
- Sharlot Hall Museum archives - any documentation of Mike's trips

### 2. Mike Burns's Second Pilgrimage Details

**ASSERTION** (from outline): "After Carlos's death, Mike made a second journey to Skeleton Cave, this time traveling alone or with minimal assistance (summer 1923). He gathered additional remains."

**QUESTIONS**:
- [ ] Is there historical evidence for a SOLO trip by Mike after January 31, 1923? **No evidence found.**
- [x] OR was the 1925 trip (with sheriff) the only second trip? **The 1925 trip is the only second trip confirmed by web search.**
- [x] If Mike went twice (1923 and 1925) 


**FINDINGS**:
- The 1925 trip with the sheriff is the only second pilgrimage that has been confirmed through web searches. 

**RESEARCH NEEDED**:
- Primary sources documenting Mike's movements 1923-1925
- Fort McDowell Yavapai oral histories
- Any Mike Burns correspondence or writings mentioning return visits

---

- [x] OR were they buried in a separate mass grave NEAR his grave? **Yes, in a separate mass grave in the same cemetery.**
- [ ] Is there evidence Mike requested bones be buried with him? **No evidence found.**
- [ ] Is there ANY evidence the bow was placed in his grave? **No evidence found, likely fictional.**
- [x] Where exactly is Mike buried? (Fort McDowell cemetery name? Location?) **Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation--Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery.**

**FINDINGS**:
- Mike Burns is buried in the Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery at Fort McDowell.
- The remains from Skeleton Cave were interred in a separate mass grave in the same cemetery in 1933.
- There is no evidence that the bones were buried with Mike, or that a bow was placed in his grave. These are likely fictional elements.

**RESEARCH NEEDED**:
- Mike Burns's grave location and burial records
- Cemetery records at Fort McDowell (Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery?)
- 1985 memorial stone details and what it commemorates
- Evidence for bow burial (appears to be fictional element from novel)

### 10. The Unfinished Bow

- [ ] OR is this entirely fictional?
- [ ] Should Chapter 27 (historical facts) include this?
