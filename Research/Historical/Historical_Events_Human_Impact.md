## SYNTHESIS: HISTORICAL EVENTS AS PERSONAL JOURNEY

### The Pattern
1. **Childhood**: Traditional Yavapai life DESTROYED by U.S. policy/violence
2. **Adolescence**: Forced assimilation IMPOSED by U.S. institutions (Carlisle)
3. **Young adulthood**: Moral compromise REQUIRED for survival (scout service)
4. **Middle age**: Citizenship CLAIMED despite cost (Burke Act)
5. **Elder years**: Truth WRITTEN for future witness (manuscript)

### The Emotional Arc
- **Loss** → **Erasure** → **Compromise** → **Reclamation** → **Witness**

### For Novel
Every historical event must be filtered through: **What did this FEEL like for Mike?**

Not: "The Skeleton Cave Massacre occurred on December 28, 1872."
But: "The sound of gunfire echoing in the cave. The smell of smoke. My mother's scream cut short. And I, Hoomothya, lived."
