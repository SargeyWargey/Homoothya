# Historical Gaps in Mike Burns's Life - Opportunities for Dramatic Fiction

**Purpose**: Identifying what we DON'T know about Mike's life - these gaps are where fiction brings history to emotional life.

---

## PRINCIPLE: GAPS ARE GIFTS

Historical gaps are not problemsâ€”they're **opportunities**. Where records are silent, fiction speaks. Where facts end, human truth begins.

**Rules for filling gaps**:
1. Must be **plausible** within historical context
2. Must serve **emotional truth** of Mike's experience
3. Must honor **cultural respect** (consult with Yavapai Nation)
4. Must advance **character arc** and story
5. Document all inventions for Author's Note

---

## GAP 1: CHILDHOOD BEFORE MASSACRE (c. 1865-1872)

### What We Know
- Born c. 1865 as Hoomothya ("Wet Nose")
- Kwevkepaya Yavapai
- Mother killed by soldiers before Skeleton Cave (date unknown)
- Father developed "bitter vengeance" after mother's death
- Extended family existed (all killed in massacre)
- Traditional Yavapai upbringing

### What We DON'T Know
- **Specific memories of normal childhood**: What made him laugh? What scared him (before soldiers)?
- **Mother's name**: Unknown
- **Father's name**: Unknown
- **Siblings?**: Unknown
- **How mother died**: "A few miles east of Mormon Flat" - circumstances?
- **What "Hoomothya" (Wet Nose) meant to him**: Was it affectionate? Descriptive? A story behind it?
- **Daily life details**: What did he eat? Wear? Do for fun? Learn?
- **Relationship dynamics**: Which family member was he closest to? Who taught him what?
- **Traditional practices**: Specific ceremonies, stories, skills he was learning
- **Yavapai language**: What phrases, songs, words were his favorites?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: Create vivid, sensory childhood scenes that make readers FALL IN LOVE with Hoomothya's world before it's destroyed.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **Ordinary morning**: Waking up, morning routine, family breakfast - mundane beauty readers will mourn
2. **Learning from father**: Tracking lesson, hunting, father's pre-grief personality
3. **Mother's memory**: A specific moment with her - her voice, her hands, her smell - that haunts him forever
4. **Playing with cousins**: Children's games, laughter, innocence
5. **Elder telling stories**: Night around fire, creation stories, Yavapai worldview
6. **Seasonal migration**: Journey to winter/summer camp, what the land looks/smells like
7. **First awareness of soldiers**: Overhearing adults, sensing fear, not understanding yet
8. **Mother's death**: Inventing this scene (with cultural consultation) - how young Mike experienced it, how father changed
9. **The name "Hoomothya"**: Why that name? Wet nose from crying? From cold? A tender story that makes the name precious

**Emotional purpose**:
- Establish what was LOST - readers must grieve this world with Mike
- Show Yavapai culture as living, specific, beautiful - not abstract "Native ways"
- Create baseline of safety/love to contrast with trauma
- Make family members real people (with names we create) that readers care about

**Research needed**:
- Kwevkepaya Yavapai daily life, seasonal patterns (research phase)
- Traditional childhood education, rites of passage
- Food, clothing, shelter specifics
- **MANDATORY**: Cultural consultation before inventing any specific practices

## GAP 2: THE SIX DAYS (December 22-28, 1872)

### What We Know
- December 22: Captured by Captain Burns
- Held as prisoner for 6 days
- Forced to lead soldiers to cave where family was camped
- "Frightened, alone, and a prisoner"
- December 28: Witnessed massacre

### What We DON'T Know
- **How captured**: Circumstances - was he alone? With family? Taken in raid?
- **First encounter with Burns**: What did Burns say/do? How did Mike experience it?
- **Daily experience of captivity**: Where did he sleep? What did he eat? Was he bound?
- **Soldier interactions**: Were they cruel? Indifferent? Did anyone show kindness?
- **Language barrier**: How did they communicate? Gestures? Translator?
- **His thoughts**: Did he try to escape? Lie about cave location? Plan resistance?
- **Physical journey**: Where were they? What route? How long walking?
- **The moment he revealed cave location**: Under duress? Threat? Torture? Deception? Or did soldiers find it another way and blame him?
- **Knowing what was coming**: Did he understand the soldiers' intent? Or innocent of what he was leading them to?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: These six days are PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE - build dread, show Mike's impossible position, complicate the betrayal.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **Capture moment**: The instant his freedom ends - terror, struggle, overwhelming force
2. **First night as prisoner**: Tied up? In camp? Hearing soldiers talk, not understanding words but understanding threat
3. **Attempts to escape**: Did he try? Failed? Punishment?
4. **A "kind" soldier**: Someone gives him food, blanket - confusing, doesn't erase captivity
5. **Burns's questioning**: How did Burns get information? Threats? Promises? Deception?
6. **The march**: Physical hardship, cold December, minimal food, exhaustion
7. **Recognizing landmarks**: Moment he realizes where they're going - panic, denial, hoping he's wrong
8. **The night before**: December 27, knowing family is close, unable to warn them, moral agony
9. **Decision point** (if applicable): Did he actively lead them? Or were they already close and forced him to confirm? (This MATTERS for his guilt)

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show Mike's complete powerlessness - he's a terrified child
- Complicate the "betrayal" - readers must understand it was under duress
- Build unbearable tension toward massacre
- Establish trauma foundation - this is psychological horror before physical horror

**Critical question for fiction**:
**HOW complicit was Mike in revealing the cave location?**
- Tortured/threatened until he revealed it? (More sympathetic)
- Deceived (told family would be safe)? (Tragic)
- Found independently by scouts, Mike just confirmed? (Less guilt)
- **CHOICE**: Research what's most historically plausible, then dramatize Mike's subjective experience

### What We Know
- Approximately 7-8 years living with Burns
- "Somewhere between captive and servant"
- Given the name Mike Burns
- Learned English
- Sent to Carlisle in September 1880

### What We DON'T Know
- **Daily life specifics**: What was his role in household? Chores? Education? Punishment?
- **Burns family**: Did Burns have a wife? Children? How did they treat Mike?
- **Where they lived**: Fort? Town? Arizona? Elsewhere?
- **Burns's motivation**: Guilt? Paternalism? Genuine affection? Claiming a war trophy?
- **Mike's response**: How did he survive this psychologically? Dissociation? Compliance? Secret resistance?
- **Language learning**: How taught? Forced? Gradual?
- **Cultural suppression**: Was Yavapai actively forbidden? Punished? Or just not mentioned?
- **Mike's inner life**: What did he think about at night? Did he dream in Yavapai? Plan revenge? Pray?
- **Relationship evolution**: Did it change over time? Warm? Remain cold? Complicated mix?
- **Contact with Yavapai people**: Any? Forbidden? Did he see other Yavapai on reservation?
- **Decision to send to Carlisle**: Burns's reasoning? Mike's feelings? Choice or order?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: These are the years Mike learns to survive by becoming someone else. Show the slow erosion and the stubborn core that resists.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **First days in Burns's home**: Alienation, fear, confusion, everything is strange
2. **First English lesson**: Struggle, frustration, gradual mastery
3. **Renaming moment**: "You are Mike Burns now" - what was said? How did he respond?
4. **First time he thinks in English**: Horror at losing Yavapai thought patterns
5. **Secret acts of resistance**: Speaking Yavapai to himself at night, remembering family stories, keeping Hoomothya alive
6. **Complicated moment with Burns**: Burns shows kindness/pride - Mike's confusion at feeling gratitude toward father's killer
7. **Seeing other Yavapai**: On reservation, in town - recognition, shame, longing, inability to connect?
8. **Burns's family dynamics** (if existed): Wife's attitude? Other children's? Mike's place in hierarchy?
9. **Mike's question**: Does he ever ask Burns "Why did you kill my family?" (Probably not, but the unasked question burns)
10. **Departure for Carlisle**: Saying goodbye - relief? Fear? Gratitude? Resentment? All?

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show impossible father/son, captor/captive relationship
- Demonstrate psychological survival strategies
- Build complexity - can hate Burns AND feel connected to him
- Show cultural loss happening in real-time
- Establish pattern: survive by adapting, but Hoomothya never fully dies

**Character question**:
**What version of Burns do we create?**
- Cruel and cold? (Simple villain)
- Paternalistic but "well-meaning"? (Complicated oppressor)
- Genuinely affectionate within racist framework? (Most complex, most painful)
- **CHOICE**: Probably the last - Burns can love Mike AND see him as inferior. This is the heartbreak.

- One of earliest students (school founded 1879)

### What We DON'T Know
- **The journey east**: Who traveled with him? What was the train ride like? First time seeing cities, forests, etc.?
- **Arrival scene**: First impression of Carlisle, Pennsylvania - so different from Arizona
- **Transformation ceremony specifics**: Who cut his hair? What was said? What did they do with his clothes?

- **Leaving for Highland**: Why? Scholarship? Pratt's recommendation? Who decided?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: Carlisle is where Mike gains the tools for witness, but loses more of his identity. Show both the brutality and the unexpected connections.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **Hair cutting ceremony**: The most iconic scene - visceral, emotional, violation
2. **First night in dormitory**: Strange bed, strange clothes, strange sounds, crying self to sleep?
3. **First English class**: Humiliation, then gradual competence, then power in literacy
4. **Punishment for speaking Yavapai**: Catching himself, the ruler crack, the pain of silencing self
5. **Secret resistance night**: Students speaking native languages in whispers, sharing stories, keeping alive
6. **A true friend**: Another student who becomes brother - what tribe? What happens to them? (Death? Assimilation? Return home?)
7. **Outing experience** (if applicable): Sent to white family for labor, experiencing more racism/dislocation
8. **Learning to write**: The moment he realizes he can record his truth - power in pen
9. **Pratt assembly speech**: Hearing "Kill the Indian, save the man" - what does Mike feel?
10. **Unexpected kindness**: A teacher who sees him as human, teaches him genuinely - confusion at complex reality
11. **Romantic moment**: If appropriate, a connection with another student - tenderness amid brutality
12. **Leaving for Highland**: Why? Excitement? Trepidation? Unable to face more Carlisle?

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show systematic cultural genocide in action
- Demonstrate Mike's adaptation AND resistance
- Create friendships that matter - their fates affect Mike
- Give him tools (literacy) that will enable his witness
- Deepen identity crisis - less Hoomothya, more Mike, hating both

**Structural note**:
These 5 years can't all be shown - select 6-8 key scenes that represent the arc:
1. Arrival/transformation
2. Language suppression
3. Finding literacy
4. Secret resistance
5. Unexpected connection (friend or kind teacher)
6. Deepening identity crisis
7. Decision to leave

## GAP 5: HIGHLAND UNIVERSITY YEAR (1885-1886)

### What We Know
- Attended Highland University, Kansas
- 1885-1886 (one year only)
- Higher education level

### What We DON'T Know
- **Why Highland**: Who arranged it? Scholarship? Burns? Pratt recommendation?
- **What he studied**: Subjects? Intended career?
- **Living situation**: Dorm? Boarding? With family?
- **Social experience**: Only Native student? How treated? Friends?
- **Why only one year**: Financial? Academic? Personal crisis? Couldn't handle isolation?
- **What happened there**: Anything significant? Formative experience? Traumatic event?
- **Transition to scout service**: Why enlist immediately after? Connection?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: THIS IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY - one year that's completely mysterious. What happened that led to scout service?

**Possible inventions**:
1. **Academic success BUT social isolation**: Excelling in studies, completely alone socially
2. **Romantic relationship gone wrong**: Connection with white woman, discovered, consequences? (Would explain sudden departure and desire to disappear into army)
3. **Racial incident**: Violence, expulsion, trauma that pushes him away
4. **Financial collapse**: Can't afford to continue, must work
5. **Identity crisis climax**: Realizes he's neither Yavapai nor white, nowhere to belong
6. **Political awakening**: Studies history, realizes scope of genocide, can't continue in white institution
7. **Recruitment**: Army recruiter on campus, offers purpose/income, Mike desperate

**Questions for novel**:
- What happened at Highland that made army scouting seem like an answer?
- Was it escape? Purpose? Last resort? Giving up on civilian life?
- Does this year represent hope (higher ed!) or deepest despair (couldn't make it work)?

**CHOICE NEEDED**: This gap is so complete that we have total freedom. What serves Mike's character arc best?
- **Suggestion**: A romantic connection that's discovered/forbidden + financial crisis = desperate enlistment
- **Or**: Realization that education won't save him from racism = chooses different path
- **Or**: Simply can't afford to continue + no other options = army only choice

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show Mike trying to build a life in white world
- That life fails (racism, economics, identity, or all three)
- Army becomes escape/last resort
- Transition from student to scout = from learning to surviving

---

## GAP 6: SCOUT SERVICE - SPECIFIC MISSIONS (1885-1888)

### What We Know
- Two enlistments: July-Dec 1885, June 1887-Dec 1888
- Rode against Sitting Bull, Geronimo
- Witnessed Little Bighorn campaign aftermath
- Served in Indian Wars

### What We DON'T Know
- **Specific missions**: What exactly did he do? Track who? See what?
- **First tracking success**: Who did he help capture? How did it feel?
- **Combat experience**: Did he see battle? Participate? Kill anyone?
- **Relationships with scouts**: Other Native men - friends? Rivals? Shared guilt?
- **Relationships with soldiers**: Who was cruel? Who was kind? Any friendships?
- **Specific incidents that haunted him**: What did he see/do that produced lifelong guilt?
- **Why re-enlist**: June 1887 - why go back? Couldn't find other work? Needed the structure? Deepening compromise?
- **Why leave**: December 1888 - discharge or choice? What made him stop?
- **Pay and conditions**: How much? Where? How treated?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: Scout years are Mike's deepest moral compromise. Create specific scenes that show the cost of survival.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **First day as scout**: Donning the uniform, the weight of irony
2. **First tracking mission**: Following signs, knowing he's hunting Native people, succeeding, sick feeling
3. **Encounter with hunted Yavapai/Apache**: Moment of recognition - they're like his family, he's betraying them
4. **Successful capture**: Pride in skill + shame in purpose = destroying him
5. **Racist soldiers**: Slurs, violence, constant reminders he's not one of them
6. **One decent soldier**: Treats him like human - doesn't erase the system but complicates Mike's feelings
7. **Fellow scout conversation**: Drinking? Talking? Justifying? Shared silence of guilt?
8. **Geronimo campaign**: Tracking the famous chief, what did Mike think?
9. **Violence witnessed**: Something he sees that crosses line, haunts forever
10. **Re-enlistment moment**: Why go back? Scene of Mike signing papers, his thoughts
11. **Breaking point**: What makes him finally leave in Dec 1888? Specific incident? Cumulative weight? Offer of other work?
12. **Final day**: Turning in uniform, walking away, empty freedom

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show impossible moral position - survival requires betrayal
- Demonstrate that Mike is not passive victim - he makes choices, lives with them
- Create specific guilt Mike will carry forever
- Show both the racism he endures AND his complicity in oppression
- Complicate our view of Mike - he's not pure victim, he's human survivor

**Critical scenes**:
- **The one that breaks him**: Inventing ONE specific mission that represents everything wrong, that makes him unable to continue
  - Example: Tracks family with young child, child reminds him of himself, they're captured/killed?
  - Example: Successful mission leads to massacre-like event, he witnesses it?
  - Example: Realizes he's tracking Yavapai specifically, can't continue?

## GAP 7: THE "LOST YEARS" (1889-1908)

### What We Know
- December 1888: Discharged from army
- July 1908: Voter registration
- That's 20 YEARS of largely unknown life

### What We DON'T Know

- **How he supported himself**: Jobs? Laborer? Translator? Government clerk?
- **Relationships**: Marriage? Children? Romance? (Unknown!)
- **Yavapai reconnection**: How did he reconnect with people? How was he received?
- **Identity work**: How did he rebuild Yavapai self after scout service?
- **Citizenship attempts**: Multiple failures before 1908 - what were they? How did rejection feel?
- **When writing impulse began**: 1910 is first documented attempt, but when did he START thinking about writing?
- **Community role**: What was his place among Yavapai people? Accepted? Suspected (former scout)? Outsider?
- **Spiritual life**: Did he return to Yavapai practices? Christian? Both? Neither?
- **Friendship with Judge Wells**: How did this develop (man he voted for in 1908)?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: 20 YEARS - this is HUGE creative freedom. What shaped Mike's path to witness?

**Possible inventions**:
1. **Difficult return to Yavapai community**: Some welcome him, some distrust (scout history), he must prove himself
2. **Romance/marriage**: Meeting someone, building a relationship, possibly ending badly (unknown if he married) OR lasting until his death
3. **Children?**: Complete unknown - if yes, what does fatherhood mean to someone who lost his parents so young?
4. **Employment struggles**: Racism in job market, taking whatever work he can find
5. **Citizenship rejections**: Specific scenes of being denied, humiliation, determination
6. **Friendship with Wells**: How it formed - Mike working for him? Shared interest in history? Genuine cross-racial friendship despite era?
7. **Yavapai elder**: An older survivor who becomes mentor, helps Mike reconnect with culture, encourages him to write
8. **Witnessing moment**: Something happens that crystallizes his need to write - another Native person's story lost? Conversation with Wells about "history"? Seeing his people erased from official record?
9. **Learning to live with guilt**: Scout service guilt - how does he process it? Alcohol? (Unknown) Work? Service to community?
10. **First writing attempts**: Before 1910, did he start? Practice? Journals? When did he get the idea?

**Structural challenge**:
Can't show all 20 years - select key moments:
1. Return/reconnection (1889-1890)
2. Building new life (early 1890s)
3. Citizenship attempts/rejections (1890s-early 1900s)
4. Friendship with Wells developing (early 1900s)
5. Decision to write crystallizing (mid 1900s)
6. Citizenship finally achieved (1908)

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show Mike building adult life from trauma/compromise
- Demonstrate reconnection with Yavapai identity
- Plant seeds of witness mission
- Create relationships/community that matter to him
- Show citizenship as complex achievement - pride + irony

**Major creative decision needed**:
**Did Mike have a family (wife/children)?**
- **If yes**: Adds domestic life, legacy concerns, someone to witness FOR beyond the dead
- **If no**: Emphasizes isolation, all energy channeled to writing, witness mission is his legacy
- **Unknown**: No historical record either way
- **Choice**: What serves the story? (Leaning toward NO - maintains focus on writing as his life's purpose)

---

## GAP 8: WRITING YEARS - DAILY LIFE (1910-1934)

### What We Know
- January 1910: Wrote to Sharlot Hall

- **What else he wrote**: Just the autobiography? Other pieces? Poetry? Letters?
- **Community role during these years**: How did people see him? Respected elder? Odd man with his writing?

### Fiction Opportunities

**GIFT THIS GAP**: These are the years Mike becomes THE WITNESS. Show the cost and beauty of that mission.

**Scenes to invent**:
1. **Writing the massacre scene (1913)**: 41 years later, putting it on paper, emotional devastation, must continue
2. **Reading a rejection letter**: Publisher says no, his people's truth dismissed, his response
3. **Sharing draft with someone**: Reader's response (moved? Uncomfortable? Can't understand?), Mike's hope/disappointment
4. **Correspondence with Hall**: Letters back and forth, her encouragement despite no publisher
5. **Moment of doubt**: Burning pages? Stopping? Then resolving to continue
6. **Community response**: Someone in Yavapai community learns of his writing, what do they say? Support? Suspicion?
7. **Writing ritual**: His daily practice, sacred act of witness, discipline despite futility
8. **Revision obsession**: Returning to same scenes, trying to get it RIGHT
9. **Aging body vs. sharp memory**: Physical decline, urgency, racing against death
10. **Decision to continue despite knowing**: Explicit moment of "I'll never see this published, but I'll finish it anyway"

**Emotional purpose**:
- Show writing as compulsion, duty, sacred act
- Demonstrate cost of witness - time, emotion, repeated rejection
- Reveal why he persists - for the dead, for truth, for itself
- Build toward 1934 - final push to complete

**For novel's structure**:
The INTERLUDES (1934) take place during these years' culmination - Mike in final months, writing at Fort McDowell. The main narrative IS this writing act.

---

## GAP 9: FINAL MONTHS AT FORT MCDOWELL (May-November 1934)

### What We Know
- May 28, 1934: Moved to Fort McDowell
- November 26, 1934: Died (some sources say Fort Whipple hospital)

**Scenes to invent** (These are the INTERLUDES):
1. **Arrival at Fort McDowell (May 1934)**: Coming home, greeted by whom? Sense of completion/peace?

4. **Physical decline**: Coughing? Weakness? Knowing death is close?
5. **Last pages of manuscript**: Final words he writes, sense of accomplishment

7. **Looking at completed manuscript**: Holding it, knowing it's done, peace/doubt/pride
8. **Final days**: Health crisis, move to hospital (Fort Whipple)? Or stayed at Fort McDowell?
9. **Last conversation**: With whom? About what? Does he ask them to protect manuscript?
10. **Death scene**: Conscious or unconscious? Peaceful or struggling? Final thoughts?

**Emotional purpose**:
- Frame entire narrative - elderly Mike writing IS the novel
- Show urgency - racing against death to complete witness
- Demonstrate peace - duty fulfilled, even if never published
- Create resonance - Hoomothya to Mike Burns to death, full circle
- Set up epilogue - manuscript survives him

**For novel's structure**:

## SYNTHESIS: HOW TO USE THESE GAPS

### The Philosophy
- **Gaps are not problems - they're gifts**
- Where history is silent, fiction speaks truth
- Invent WITH purpose: character, emotion, theme
- Document all inventions for Author's Note

### The Process
1. **Identify gap**: What don't we know?
2. **Ask "Why does it matter?"**: How does filling this gap serve story/character?
3. **Research context**: What's plausible within time/place/culture?
4. **Invent WITH constraints**: Must fit facts we do have
5. **Consult**: Cultural content requires Yavapai Nation consultation
6. **Document**: Track what's invented vs. documented

### The Checklist (For Each Gap)
- [ ] Is it historically plausible?
- [ ] Does it serve character arc?
- [ ] Does it advance emotional truth?
- [ ] Have I consulted where required (cultural content)?
- [ ] Have I documented it for Author's Note?

### Priority Gaps for Fiction (Most Important)
1. **Six days of captivity (Dec 22-28, 1872)**: Builds to massacre, shows Mike's powerlessness
2. **Life with Burns (1873-1880)**: Shows impossible relationship, cultural erosure
3. **Highland year (1885-86)**: Total mystery, opportunity to create turning point
4. **Specific scout missions (1885-88)**: Show moral compromise in action
5. **Lost years (1889-1908)**: 20 years to shape path to witness
6. **1934 at Fort McDowell**: Framing device, must be powerful

### For Author's Note
All gaps filled by fiction must be acknowledged:
- "Historical record is silent on [X]. I have imagined [Y] based on [Z context]."
- "Mike Burns's [specific experience] is not documented. This portrayal is fiction grounded in [historical research]."
- Be transparent about what's invented while defending its emotional truth

---

**The gaps are where Mike's humanity lives. Facts give us skeleton; fiction gives us breath, heartbeat, tears. Use these gifts wisely.**
