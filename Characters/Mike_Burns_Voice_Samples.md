# Mike Burns - Character Voice Samples Across Life Stages

**Purpose**: Demonstrate Mike's evolving voice from childhood through old age to guide first-person narration in the novel.

---

## AGE 7 - HOOMOTHYA (c. 1872, Before the Massacre)

### Voice Characteristics
- Simple, sensory, immediate
- Wonder and curiosity
- Present-tense feeling
- Trusting, secure in his world
- Child's logic and observation

### Sample 1: Gathering Mesquite Beans

The mesquite pods hung heavy on the branches, fat and sweet-smelling in the sun. Mother reached up and pulled one down, showed me how to test it between my fingers. "Feel here, Hoomothya. When it's soft like this, it's ready."

I tried. The pod gave under my thumb, just a little. I grinned at her and she laughed, that sound I loved, and handed me the gathering basket. "Fill it halfway before you eat any," she said, but her eyes were smiling. She knew I would eat some. She always knew.

The taste was sweet and dusty at once, like the earth and the sun mixed together.

### Sample 2: Noticing Father's Change (After Mother's First Death)

Father doesn't smile anymore. Not since the day the soldiers came through the canyon where Mother was digging roots. He won't talk about it, but I heard Aunt's voice in the night, low and angry. "They killed her for nothing. She had no weapon. She was gathering *food*."

Now Father's hands are always tight, always ready. His eyes look past me sometimes, like he's seeing something I can't. When he checks his weapons, he doesn't hum the old songs. He's quiet. The whole camp is quiet now.

I don't understand why the soldiers hurt Mother. She never hurt anyone.

### Sample 3: Playing With Cousins

"Catch me if you can!" My cousin darted between the rocks, laughing, and I chased after him, feet sure on the stone. This was our canyon, our place. We knew every handhold, every shadow, every place the lizards sunned themselves.

We ran until we were breathless, until the sun dropped behind the ridge and turned everything gold. Then we sat on the warm rocks and watched the swallows dart and dive, snatching insects from the air.

"Do you think we'll always live here?" he asked.

"Where else would we go?" I said. "This is home."

## AGE 8-10 - MIKE BURNS (1872-1874, Early Years with Captain Burns)

### Voice Characteristics
- Careful, watchful, guarded
- Survival calculation embedded in observations
- Divided self: Hoomothya inside, Mike outside
- Beginning to code-switch
- Trauma underneath every word

### Sample 1: Learning His New Name

"Your name is Mike now. Mike Burns. Say it."

The captain's voice was not unkind, but it left no room for argument. I tried to make my tongue form the sounds. "Mike."

"Good. Mike Burns. That's who you are now."

But he was wrong. I was Hoomothya. The name my mother gave me. The name that meant something in my language, not his. Inside my head, I was still Hoomothya. I would always be Hoomothya.

I just couldn't say it out loud anymore.

"Mike Burns," I repeated, and watched him nod, satisfied.

### Sample 2: First Meal at Burns's Table

I didn't know how to use the fork. I watched the captain's hands, the way he held it, the way he brought it to his mouth. Everything had rules here, invisible rules I didn't know.

The food tasted wrong. Not bad, just wrong. It didn't taste like mesquite cakes or venison or the wild greens Mother used to gather. It tasted like this new world I was trapped in.

The captain's wife watched me struggle with the fork. She didn't smile, but she didn't frown either. She just watched, like I was something strange she was trying to understand.

I wanted to eat with my hands. I wanted to run. I wanted my father.

I picked up the fork and copied what the captain did.

### Sample 3: Night Terrors

At night, I can still hear the gunfire echoing off the cave walls. I can still hear the screaming, the way it stopped, the terrible silence after. I press my face into the pillow they gave me and try not to make any sound.

If I cry out, someone will come. The captain will ask what's wrong. How do I tell him? How do I say: You killed them. You killed everyone. I watched you do it.

So I stay quiet. I have learned that staying quiet keeps me safe.

In the dark, I whisper in Yavapai. Just a few words. Just enough to remember I am still Hoomothya, even if no one else knows it.

---

## AGE 16-18 - MIKE BURNS (1881-1883, Carlisle Years)

### Voice Characteristics
- More sophisticated vocabulary, educated
- Code-switching pronounced
- Analytical, beginning to see systems of oppression
- Loneliness and isolation
- Internal resistance while outwardly compliant

### Sample 1: Hair Cutting Ceremony (Age 15)

They cut my hair today.

I sat in the chair and felt the scissors—cold metal against my neck—and watched black strands fall to the floor. Each cut felt like losing something I couldn't name. The hair my mother's hands had touched. The hair that marked me as Yavapai.

Mr. Pratt stood watching, hands behind his back. "You are being civilized," he said. "This is for your own good."

I wanted to ask: whose good? But I had learned not to ask questions like that. I had learned to sit still, to let them do what they would do anyway, to keep my face empty of everything I felt.

When they were finished, I looked in the mirror and didn't recognize myself.

That was the point, I suppose.

### Sample 2: Secret Language

We weren't supposed to speak our languages. Mr. Pratt said English was the only language we needed, the only language worth knowing. He said our languages were savage, primitive, holding us back from civilization.

But late at night, in the dormitory, when the teachers had gone to bed, we whispered. Apache, Lakota, Yavapai, Pueblo, Navajo—all of us speaking the words they tried to beat out of us. Quiet, so quiet, but defiant.

"Hoomothya," I whispered to myself. My real name. The name I couldn't speak in daylight.

The boy in the next bed—John, they called him, though his real name was something beautiful in Lakota—heard me and smiled in the dark. He understood. We all understood.

They could cut our hair and change our clothes and punish us for speaking. But they couldn't cut out our tongues. They couldn't silence what we remembered.

### Sample 3: Recognizing Contradiction

Today in class, Mr. Garfield taught us about the Declaration of Independence. "All men are created equal," he read, his voice swelling with pride. "Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."

I raised my hand. "Sir, if all men are created equal, why are we here?"

The classroom went silent. Mr. Garfield's face colored. "You are here to be *civilized*, Michael. To be brought *up* to equality."

So we are equal, but we must be brought up to it. We have unalienable rights, but those rights can be taken away. We are men, but we are also savages who must be killed and saved.

I did not ask my next question. I had learned when to stop.

But I wrote it down in my journal that night: *Whose words are true, and whose are lies?*

## AGE 21-23 - MIKE BURNS (1886-1888, Scout Years)

### Voice Characteristics
- Clipped, military precision
- Emotional restraint, compartmentalization
- Practical, tactical observations
- Guilt beneath the surface
- Hardening to survive the moral weight

### Sample 1: First Tracking Assignment

The tracks were two days old, heading west into the rough country. Four adults, two children, moving fast. Scared.

I knew how to read this story. I had been taught by the best—by my own people, before they were killed. Now I used those skills to hunt others like me.

"Can you track them, Burns?" Lieutenant Morrison asked.

"Yes, sir," I said. Because that was my job. Because I had enlisted for this. Because I needed the pay and I had nowhere else to go.

"Good. Let's move out."

I knelt and studied the prints. A woman's foot, narrow, running. A child's print, small, stumbling. They were tired. Hungry. Fleeing for their lives.

Just like my family had fled.

I stood up and pointed west. "This way, sir."

### Sample 2: Night in Camp with Fellow Scouts

We sat around the fire, saying nothing. The white soldiers were in their own camp, fifty yards away, laughing and playing cards. We weren't invited. We were never invited.

Charlie—they called him Charlie, but he was Mescalero Apache, and I never learned his real name—passed a canteen. Whiskey. I took a swallow. It burned, but it helped.

"You ever think about it?" he asked quietly. In Apache, not English.

I didn't have to ask what he meant. "Every day."

"Me too."

We sat in silence. There was nothing else to say. We both knew what we were doing. We both knew what we'd become. Talking about it wouldn't change it.

In the morning, we'd track again. We'd do our job. We'd survive.

That was all that was left.

### Sample 3: After a Successful Hunt

We caught up to them at dawn. They'd made camp in an arroyo, thinking they were hidden. They weren't.

The soldiers surrounded them before they woke. It was over quickly. No shots fired. Just surrender.

I watched the Apache man's face when he saw me. Saw his eyes take in my uniform, my rifle, my brown skin. Saw him understand what I was. His expression didn't change, but I felt his judgment like a knife.

*Traitor*, his eyes said. *You are one of us, and you hunt us.*

"Good work, Burns," the lieutenant said, clapping my shoulder.

I said nothing. I watched them tie the Apache family's hands. Watched them prepare to march them back to the reservation. Watched the children cry.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept seeing that man's eyes.

I kept thinking: he was right.

## AGE 35-40 - MIKE BURNS (1900-1905, Searching Years)

### Voice Characteristics
- Reflective, articulating contradictions
- Searching for identity and purpose
- Beginning witness consciousness
- Weariness mixed with determination
- Questions without easy answers

### Sample 1: Visiting Fort McDowell Reservation

I stood at the edge of the reservation and watched the Yavapai people going about their lives. Gathering, cooking, talking. Living, despite everything.

I didn't know if I belonged here. I had been gone so long. I had done so much. Would they accept me? Did I deserve acceptance?

An old woman looked up and saw me standing there. Our eyes met. She was Yavapai—I could see it in her face, the shape of her eyes, the way she held herself. Maybe she had known my family. Maybe she had survived when they hadn't.

I wanted to go to her. I wanted to speak Yavapai, to hear it spoken back to me. I wanted to ask: *Do you remember them? My mother, my father, the ones who died at the cave?*

But I didn't move. I stood there, caught between going forward and turning back.

I had been Mike Burns for so long, I didn't know if Hoomothya still existed.

### Sample 2: Attempting to Register to Vote (Pre-1906)

"You can't register," the clerk said, not looking up from his papers.

"Why not? I'm a citizen. I served in the U.S. Army for three years."

"You're an Indian." He said it like that explained everything. "Indians aren't citizens."

"I was born here. In Arizona Territory."

"Doesn't matter. Indian." He pushed the registration form away. "Next."

I stood there, hands clenched. I had tracked for them. I had scouted for them. I had learned their language, worn their uniform, fought their wars. And I still wasn't one of them.

I would never be one of them.

But I wasn't fully Yavapai anymore either.

I was caught between worlds, belonging to neither, accepted by none.

### Sample 3: First Thoughts of Writing

I need to write this down.

The thought came to me last night, sudden and certain. I am getting older. The others who survived—there are so few of us left. Who will tell what happened if I don't?

The white people have their histories, their books, their versions of events. They have written about the Tonto Wars, the Skeleton Cave fight (they call it a fight, not a massacre). They have written about civilizing the savage, taming the wilderness, winning the West.

But they haven't written the truth.

They don't know what it was like to be a seven-year-old boy watching his family die. They don't know what it was like to have your name taken, your language forbidden, your identity erased. They don't know what it cost to survive.

I know. I am the only one living who knows.

So I must write it down. Even if no one ever reads it. Even if I am speaking into silence.

I must witness. It's all I have left.

## AGE 45-50 - MIKE BURNS (1910-1915, Early Writing Years)

### Voice Characteristics
- Driven by purpose
- Direct, unflinching
- Mature perspective forming
- Persistence despite rejection
- Historical consciousness

### Sample 1: Letter to Sharlot Hall (January 6, 1910)

Dear Miss Hall,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to ask for your help.

I am an Apache Indian of this Territory and received a little education at Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. I want to write a little history of the Apaches, including my own history, but I don't know where to send such writing to be published.

Can you give me the address of a man or a magazine that might be interested?

I am going to tell the white people that they have heard only one side of the stories about how bad the Apaches were to the whites. There is another side. My side. The side of the people who were killed.

I hope you can help me.

Respectfully,
Mike Burns

### Sample 2: Writing the Massacre Scene (1913)

I have been trying to write about December 28, 1872 for three days now. My hand shakes when I pick up the pen. I am 48 years old, and I am shaking like a child.

But I must write it. Forty-one years have passed, and I must finally put it into words.

There is no history of a civilized race that they have murdered one another as the American soldiers had done to my people in the year of 1872. They have slaughtered men, women, and children without mercy.

I was there. I saw it. I am the only one living now to tell about what happened to my people.

The cave. The gunfire. The screaming. The silence.

I close my eyes and I am eight years old again, watching my entire world end.

I open my eyes and I am an old man, alone at a table, writing words no one may ever read.

But I write them anyway. Because they must be written. Because silence is another kind of death.

### Sample 3: After Another Rejection

The letter came back today. Another publisher, another rejection. "Not interested in Indian stories at this time."

Not interested.

Seventy-six people died in that cave. My mother, my father, my aunts and uncles, my cousins. Children I played with. Elders who taught me. All of them murdered in a single morning.

And white people are not interested.

I put the letter aside and picked up my pen again. I don't write for publishers anymore. I write because the dead deserve witness. I write because someday—maybe not in my lifetime, maybe not for a hundred years—someone will want to know the truth.

And when they do, my words will be waiting.

I am the only one living to tell. So I will keep telling, whether anyone listens or not.

## AGE 65-69 - ELDER MIKE BURNS (1930-1934, Final Years) **[PRIMARY NOVEL VOICE]**

### Voice Characteristics
- Powerful, direct, unflinching
- Full life perspective, seeing the arc
- Urgent—time is short
- Reflective but immediate when recalling memories
- Moral clarity without self-righteousness
- Peace-seeking through testimony
- **This is the voice that narrates the novel**

### Sample 1: Opening His Manuscript (Fort McDowell, 1934)

I am writing this at Fort McDowell, in the small house they have given me. I am sixty-nine years old. I do not know how much time I have left, but I know this: I must finish this story.

My name is Mike Burns. I was born Hoomothya, which means Wet Nose in the Yavapai language. I am the only survivor of the Skeleton Cave Massacre of December 28, 1872. I am the only one living to tell what happened that day.

For sixty-two years I have carried this story. For twenty-four years I have been writing it down, trying to find the words that will make white people understand. I have failed to find a publisher. I have failed to make anyone care.

But I will not fail to witness.

This is my story. This is my people's story. These words are all I have left to give them.

So I will write until I can't write anymore. And then I will die knowing I did what I was meant to do.

I told the truth.

### Sample 2: Reflecting on Captain Burns

Captain James Burns was the man who captured me. He was the man who led the soldiers to the cave where my family died. He was also the man who raised me, fed me, sent me to school.

For years, white people have asked me: did you love him or hate him?

The answer is: yes.

I loved him because he was the only father I knew after my real father died. I hated him because he killed my real father. Both things are true. I have learned that a human heart can hold love and rage at the same time, can feel gratitude and grief in the same breath.

Captain Burns saved my life. Captain Burns destroyed my life.

I am sixty-nine years old, and I still don't know how to reconcile those two truths. Maybe there is no reconciliation. Maybe some contradictions you just carry until you die.

### Sample 3: Describing the Massacre (As Elderly Mike Recalls It)

I need to tell you about December 28, 1872. I need you to understand what happened in that cave.

I was eight years old. The soldiers had captured me six days earlier and forced me to lead them to where my people were hiding. I didn't want to. I was terrified. But I was a child and a prisoner, and I had no choice.

The cave was high up in the canyon wall, above the Salt River. My family thought they were safe there. They were wrong.

The soldiers surrounded the cave at dawn. I watched from below, frozen, unable to speak or run or do anything at all.

Captain Brown called up to the cave, demanding surrender. My people called back, asking for time to talk. The captain gave the order to fire anyway.

The sound—I cannot describe the sound. Gunfire echoing off stone, screaming, children crying, and then the terrible, terrible silence.

Seventy-six people died that morning. Most of them were women and children. They died because they were Yavapai. They died because this land was wanted by white settlers. They died because they were in the way.

I am the only one who lived.

I am sixty-nine years old, and I still hear the echoes of that gunfire in my dreams.

### Sample 4: On Writing Despite Rejection

For twenty-four years I have been writing this manuscript. For twenty-four years, publishers have told me no one wants to read about Indians. No one cares about the Tonto Wars. No one is interested in one man's story.

But this isn't one man's story. This is the story of a people who were nearly destroyed. This is the story of a massacre that was called a battle, of children who were called combatants, of genocide that was called progress.

I write it anyway.

Maybe no one will read these words until I am long dead. Maybe they will sit in an archive somewhere, gathering dust, waiting for someone to care. Maybe they will be thrown away when I die.

It doesn't matter. I am not writing for tomorrow. I am writing for history. I am writing for the day—ten years from now, fifty years, a hundred—when someone asks: what really happened? What was it like?

And my words will be waiting to answer.

### Sample 5: Final Entry (November 1934)

I am tired now. So tired. But the manuscript is finished.

I have told the story of Hoomothya, the Yavapai child. I have told the story of Mike Burns, the Army scout. I have told the story of the massacre, the boarding school, the years of being caught between two worlds.

I have done what I needed to do.

If you are reading this, then you are the person I have been writing for all these years. You are the one who cared enough to listen. Thank you.

I am going to rest now. I am going home to my people—not in body, for I am already at Fort McDowell among the Yavapai. But home in spirit. Home to the ones who died before me. Home to my mother and father, to my aunts and uncles, to my cousins and friends.

I am the only one living to tell.

But soon, I won't be living anymore.

The story will have to speak for itself.

## FOR NOVEL USE

The novel should be narrated primarily in **Elder Mike's voice** (age 65-69), looking back across his entire life. When he recalls specific periods, the voice should shift subtly to reflect how he experienced events at that age, while maintaining the mature perspective of the elder telling the story.

**Structure**:
- **Frame**: 1934, Fort McDowell, elderly Mike writing
- **Flashbacks**: Rendered with immediacy of memory, but filtered through elder consciousness
- **Voice shifts**: Gradual evolution from childhood wonder → trauma → hardening → wisdom

**Key**: Mike at 69 *remembers* being seven, but tells it with sixty-two years of perspective. The reader experiences both the child's sensory immediacy AND the elder's understanding of what it meant.

This dual consciousness—the child who experienced it and the elder who witnesses it—creates the novel's emotional power.
