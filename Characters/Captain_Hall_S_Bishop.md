# Captain Hall S. Bishop

**Rank**: Second Lieutenant → First Lieutenant (1878) → Captain
**Unit**: Company G, Fifth U.S. Cavalry; later Company A under Captain Jacob Auger
**Service Period with Mike**: 1874-1880 (Mike's primary guardian)
**Character**: "Never afraid of anything," "brave young man"

**PRIMARY SOURCE**: Mike Burns's manuscript provides the ONLY detailed account of Bishop's character and relationship with Mike. His testimony is authoritative.

Captain Hall S. Bishop was Mike Burns's primary guardian from 1874 to 1880—six formative years when Mike transformed from a traumatized nine-year-old orphan to a young man ready for education. Mike remembered Bishop as being "like a father," a man who "loved me as a child" and whose final goodbye in 1880 left both of them in tears. Their relationship represents one of the novel's central emotional anchors: genuine love across an impossible divide.

## Taking Custody of Mike (1874)

### Circumstances

When Captain James Burns died in 1874 at Navajo Springs, nine-year-old Mike Burns needed a new guardian. He was given to Lieutenant Hall S. Bishop.

**Why Bishop?**
- Unknown if Burns designated Bishop before death
- Possible Bishop and Burns were friends/fellow officers
- Bishop likely volunteered or was assigned by command

**What This Meant**:
Mike, still grieving his Yavapai family killed at Skeleton Cave (1872) and now losing his adoptive father Captain Burns (1874), was once again passed to a stranger. For the third time in two years, Mike had to adapt to a new life.

**Bishop's Response**:
Unlike treating Mike as a burden or curiosity, Bishop genuinely loved the boy. Mike's testimony makes clear this wasn't performative or dutiful—Bishop treated Mike as his child.

## Character: Mike's Portrait

### "Like a Father"

Mike's characterization of Bishop is consistently affectionate and admiring:

**Character Traits**:
> "Never afraid of anything"

> "Brave young man"

> "Loved me as a child"

**Relationship Quality**:
Bishop was "like a father" to Mike—the third father figure in Mike's life:
1. His biological Yavapai father (killed at Skeleton Cave 1872)
2. Captain James Burns (died 1874)
3. Lieutenant/Captain Hall S. Bishop (1874-1880)

Of the three, Bishop had the longest sustained relationship with Mike during his childhood years.

### The Man Mike Knew

**Courage**: Mike emphasized Bishop was "never afraid of anything"—important to a boy who had witnessed massacre and needed to feel protected.

**Youth**: Bishop was a "young man," likely in his 20s or early 30s when he took custody of Mike. Young enough to be energetic, old enough to be responsible.

**Genuine Affection**: Mike's account makes clear Bishop's love wasn't obligation. He chose to care for Mike, chose to invest in his education, chose to cry when they parted.

---

## Life Together (1874-1880)

### Fort Whipple (1874)

After Captain Burns's death, Bishop brought Mike to Fort Whipple near Prescott. This began six years of military life across the frontier.

### Camp Supply, Indian Territory (1875-1876)

Bishop took Mike to Camp Supply when Fifth Cavalry was transferred. Mike lived with Bishop in officer's quarters, experiencing daily military life.

**Mike's Role**: Not clear if Mike had formal duties, but he learned military routines, observed soldier life, began absorbing English more fully.

### Sioux War / Starvation Campaign (May-August 1876)

**The Campaign**:
Bishop brought 10-11 year old Mike on the Sioux War campaign:
- Left Camp Supply early May 1876
- Train from Fort Lyon to Denver to Cheyenne
- Fort D.A. Russell, Fort Laramie
- Battles: Sage Creek, Crazy Woman's Forks, Powder River
- Joined General Crook on Goose Creek
- Slim Buttes Fight (killed Yellow Hand)
- Starvation period: ate horsemeat, wild onions, berries
- Nearly starved (one hardtack per day)
- Black Hills, Red Cloud Agency
- Returned to Fort McPherson, Nebraska

**Why Bring a Child?**:
This question haunts modern readers—why bring an 11-year-old on a brutal military campaign? Possible reasons:
- No one else to care for Mike
- Common practice for officers' "wards"
- Mike already experienced in rough frontier conditions
- Bishop wanted to keep Mike close/safe
- Educational opportunity (dark as that sounds)

**Impact on Mike**:
Mike witnessed more violence, more hardship, more death. But he also learned survival skills, met famous figures (Buffalo Bill Cody, Frank Grouard), and saw Bishop's courage firsthand.

### Fort Brown / Fort Washakie, Wyoming (1877-1878)

**September 1877**: Arrived with Bishop
**Location**: Shoshone Agency area
**Experience**:
- Met Chief Washakie (looked like George Washington, big, tall, fine-looking, long white hair, rode white horse)
- Hot springs incident—Mike got sick, coughing
- Bannock scare (Indians from Fort Hall, Idaho)—small skirmish
- Witnessed Sun Dance
- Fort Brown renamed Fort Washakie in chief's honor

**Promotion**: Bishop became First Lieutenant in 1878

### Legal Trouble: The Shooting Incident

**The Crime**:
Bishop shot a butcher on the road to Fort Whipple (year unclear, but during his service with Mike).

**Civilian Justice**:
Tried in civilian court in Prescott. Fined $500.

**Military Justice**:
Court-martialed for conduct unbecoming an officer.

**General Crook's Intervention**:
The court martial wanted harsh punishment. General Crook rejected the sentence, gave Bishop only 3 months confinement instead.

**Mike's Account**:
Mike recorded this incident without judgment. He presented it as fact—Bishop shot someone, was punished, Crook intervened. No indication Mike thought less of Bishop for it.

**Questions**:
- Why did Bishop shoot the butcher? Self-defense? Argument? Drunkenness?
- What were the circumstances?
- How did this affect Bishop's career?
- Was this part of why he was later transferred to Company A?

**Character Implication**:
Bishop was "never afraid of anything"—possibly including consequences. His courage may have had a reckless edge. Yet Crook's intervention suggests Bishop was valued officer despite this incident.

### Company A Transfer (1878)

**New Assignment**: Company A, Fifth Cavalry under Captain Jacob Auger
**Location**: Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming

Unclear if transfer was promotion, lateral move, or consequence of shooting incident.

### White River Ute Crisis (November 1878)

**The Event**: Chief Ouray's band killed Agent Meeker, captured Meeker's daughter. Major Thornburgh killed.

**Fifth Cavalry Response**: Sent from Fort D.A. Russell to intervene.

**Bishop's Orders**: Deploy with troops.

**Mike's Situation**: Bishop couldn't take Mike on this campaign. Left Mike at Fort D.A. Russell to "care for Bishop's house and furniture."

**Mike's Support**: $12/month allowance at sutler's store.

**Duration**: Troops gone ~2 months until Meeker girl was freed.

**What This Shows**:
- Bishop trusted 13-year-old Mike with responsibility
- Mike had his own living arrangement (Bishop's quarters)
- Bishop ensured Mike had money for supplies
- First extended separation since Bishop took custody 1874

### Fort Laramie (Spring 1879 - September 1880)

**The Move**: Fifth Cavalry HQ relocated to Fort Laramie.

**Bishop's Decision**: He urged Mike to attend day school with soldiers' children.

**Mike's Education**: ~4 months of formal schooling, plus continued learning from soldiers and daily life.

**Summer 1880**: Mike rode mail route between Fort Laramie and Sidney Bridge (100 miles) three times—possibly at Bishop's arrangement for work experience.

**General Merritt's Offer**: September 1880, General Merritt offered Mike chance to go to school.

---

## The Goodbye (September 1880)

### The Decision

General Merritt offered Mike the opportunity to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Bishop supported this decision—understanding that Mike needed formal education beyond what frontier posts could provide.

**Why Send Him Away?**:
- Carlisle offered education Bishop couldn't provide
- Mike's future required more than military life
- Bishop wanted better opportunities for Mike
- Age 15-16—critical time for education

**The Cost**:
Sending Mike away meant losing the boy Bishop had raised for six years. It meant their daily relationship would end.

### The Parting

**Location**: Cheyenne, Wyoming
**Action**: Bishop took Mike to Cheyenne, put him on train to Carlisle

**Mike's Account**:
> "Both shed tears"

This simple statement captures profound emotion. A cavalry captain and a Yavapai teenager, crying at a train station. Six years of life together ending. Bishop losing the child he loved. Mike losing the father who raised him.

**What Made Them Cry?**:
- Genuine love across impossible circumstances
- Uncertainty about whether they'd meet again
- Mike's fear of unknown future
- Bishop's pride and sorrow
- Loss of daily companionship
- End of Mike's childhood with Bishop

**Bishop's Character Revealed**:
The fact that Bishop cried—and that Mike recorded it—shows:
- Bishop's love was genuine, not performative
- He wasn't ashamed to show emotion
- Their bond transcended officer/ward formality
- Mike mattered to Bishop as a person, not a duty

## Final Meeting (October 1885)

**Location**: Camp Supply, Indian Territory
**Mike's Situation**: Now 20-21 years old, enlisted as U.S. Army scout
**Bishop's Rank**: Captain

**Five Years Later**:
Mike had attended Carlisle (1880-1882), worked in New York and Ohio (1881-1884), attended Highland University Kansas (1884-1885), and enlisted as scout (July 1885). Bishop had been promoted to Captain.

**The Reunion**:
When Mike passed through Camp Supply in October 1885, he met Bishop—now Captain.

**Bishop's Words**:
> "Perhaps we will never meet again"

**The Weight of Those Words**:
Bishop knew the realities of frontier life. Mike was heading to dangerous scout duty in New Mexico and Arizona. Bishop's military career would take him elsewhere. The chances of another meeting were slim.

This was their final documented encounter.

**Did They Ever Meet Again?**:
Unknown. Mike's manuscript doesn't record any further meetings. Bishop may have died, been transferred far away, or their paths simply never crossed again.

## What Bishop Gave Mike

### Stability (1874-1880)

Six years—the longest stable relationship Mike had after Skeleton Cave. In those six years, Mike learned:
- English language and literacy
- Military culture and discipline
- How to navigate white American society
- Survival skills on frontier campaigns
- The experience of being genuinely loved

### Education

Bishop didn't just keep Mike alive—he actively pursued Mike's education:
- Encouraged school attendance at Fort Laramie
- Supported General Merritt's offer of Carlisle
- Sacrificed their relationship so Mike could have opportunities
- Cried at parting but still sent him

This wasn't obligation. This was love.

### A Model of Manhood

Bishop showed Mike what it meant to be a man:
- Courage ("never afraid of anything")
- Affection (loved Mike openly)
- Responsibility (cared for him six years)
- Sacrifice (sent him away for his own good)
- Emotion (cried at goodbye)

Mike's own character—his courage, his determination, his emotional honesty in his writing—may have been shaped by Bishop's example.

---

## For the Novel: Bishop as Character

### The Third Father

Mike's novel arc involves three fathers:
1. **Biological father**: Yavapai man, killed at Skeleton Cave
2. **Captain James Burns**: Destroyer who became protector, died before promises fulfilled
3. **Captain Hall S. Bishop**: The one who raised him longest, loved him most steadily

Each father represents different aspects of Mike's identity and loss.

### Key Scenes to Develop

1. **First Meeting** (1874): Nine-year-old Mike, grief-stricken over Captain Burns's death, meeting young Lieutenant Bishop. Bishop choosing to see Mike as a child to love, not a burden to manage.

2. **Daily Life** (1874-1880): Moments that build love—Bishop teaching Mike to read, Mike caring for Bishop's quarters, shared meals, conversations in broken English, laughter amid hardship.

3. **The Sioux Campaign** (1876): Eleven-year-old Mike witnessing war again. Bishop protecting him. The starvation period—sharing one hardtack. Bishop's courage under fire. Mike learning what he's capable of surviving.

4. **The Shooting Incident**: Mike learning Bishop isn't perfect. How does young Mike process his father figure's violence and punishment? Does it echo the violence that orphaned him?

5. **School Decision** (1879-1880): Bishop urging Mike to go to school. Mike resistant or eager? Bishop explaining why education matters. The growing awareness that their time together is ending.

6. **The Goodbye** (September 1880): The train station in Cheyenne. What they said. What they couldn't say. Both crying. The train pulling away. Bishop watching until Mike disappeared.

7. **The Final Meeting** (October 1885): Two men now, not officer and boy. Bishop proud of what Mike's become. The weight of "perhaps we will never meet again." What's left unsaid because it's too painful.

### Character Complexity

**Bishop Cannot Be**:
- Perfect father figure who erases Mike's trauma
- Simple white savior
- One-dimensional "good guy"

**Bishop Must Be**:
- Genuinely loving AND part of the system that destroyed Mike's people
- Courageous AND flawed (shooting incident)
- Devoted to Mike AND willing to send him away
- Complex enough that Mike could love him while understanding the contradiction

### The Emotional Truth

**The Core Question**: How could Mike love the man who served the army that massacred his family?

**The Answer**: Because humans are complex. Because a child needs love to survive. Because Bishop's love was real even if the system was evil. Because Mike could hold both truths—Bishop loved him AND the Fifth Cavalry killed his father.

**For the Novel**: Don't resolve this contradiction. Let it exist, painfully, beautifully, unbearably real.

## Research Gaps

**What We Know** (from Mike):
- Second Lieutenant promoted to Captain between 1874-1885
- Company G, later Company A under Captain Jacob Auger
- Served at Fort Whipple, Camp Supply, Fort Washakie, Fort Laramie
- Shot a butcher, court-martialed, Crook intervened
- Loved Mike "like a father"
- Cried at parting 1880
- Final meeting October 1885 at Camp Supply

**What We Need**:
- Bishop's full military service record
- Details of shooting incident—what happened?
- His background before meeting Mike
- Whether he had family of his own (wife, children?)
- What happened to him after 1885
- Did he have other Native wards or was Mike unique?
- Military records of court martial and Crook's intervention

**Questions for Novel**:
- Why did Bishop take Mike in? Ordered? Volunteered? Why?
- Did he see Mike as son? Or ward he grew to love?
- What did he think about Skeleton Cave? About the Fifth Cavalry's role?
- Did he ever express guilt about the system he served?
- Did he write letters about Mike? Keep a diary?

---

## Thematic Significance

Bishop represents:

**The Possibility of Love Across Divides**: He and Mike genuinely loved each other despite impossible circumstances.

**The Limits of Individual Goodness**: Bishop's love for Mike didn't change the system that destroyed Mike's people.

**Sacrifice and Loss**: Both sacrificed—Bishop sent away the child he loved; Mike lost his most stable father figure.

**The Complexity of Memory**: Mike remembered Bishop with pure affection. No recorded anger or resentment. Just love and loss.
