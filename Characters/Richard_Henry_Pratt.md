# Richard Henry Pratt (1840-1924)

**Role in Mike Burns's Story**: Founder and superintendent of Carlisle Indian Industrial School; architect of the assimilation system that shaped Mike's education and identity (1880-1885)

## Historical Overview

**Full Name**: Richard Henry Pratt
**Life**: December 6, 1840 - March 15, 1924
**Military Rank**: Captain (later Brigadier General, retired)
**Key Role**: Founder and Superintendent, Carlisle Indian Industrial School (1879-1904)
**Philosophy**: "Kill the Indian, Save the Man"
**Historical Impact**: Created the model for 357+ Indian boarding schools across America

## The Philosophy of Cultural Erasure

### "Kill the Indian, Save the Man"

**Pratt's famous quote** (1892 speech):
> "A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man."

**What this meant in practice**:
- Complete suppression of Native languages, cultures, religions
- Forced adoption of European-American dress, names, behaviors
- Industrial training to create manual laborers, not educated equals
- "Civilization" defined as total cultural annihilation

### Pratt's Worldview

**He genuinely believed**:
- Native cultures were inferior and doomed
- Assimilation was merciful compared to extermination
- He was "saving" Indian children from inevitable destruction
- Education and Christianity would "civilize" Native peoples
- Individual Indians could become "Americans" if stripped of tribal identity

**The profound cruelty**:
- His "kindness" was predicated on cultural genocide
- He saw nothing worth preserving in Native cultures
- Love for individual students coexisted with contempt for their heritage
- He couldn't see the violence in what he called salvation

## Carlisle Indian Industrial School (1879-1918)

### Pratt's Creation

**Founded**: 1879 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania
**Model**: Military-style boarding school in abandoned army barracks
**Enrollment**: Eventually served 10,000+ students from 140+ tribes
**Pratt's Tenure**: Superintendent 1879-1904 (forced to resign)
**Legacy**: Template for 357+ government-funded Indian boarding schools

### The System Pratt Built

**Arrival Transformation**:
- Forcible hair cutting (profound cultural violation)
- Assignment of English names (erasure of tribal identity)
- Uniforms (military-style regimentation)
- English-only rule with harsh punishment for Native languages

**Daily Regimentation** (Mike Burns experienced this):
- 6:00 AM wake-up (whistles, bells, clocks)
- Military-style marching between activities
- Academic classes (reading, writing, English)
- Industrial labor (boys: trades; girls: domestic work)
- Mandatory Christian religious services (daily + twice on Sundays)
- 9:00 PM taps and room inspection

**The "Outing System"** (Pratt called it "the supreme Americanizer"):
- Students placed with white families or businesses
- Unpaid or low-paid labor disguised as cultural education
- Summers and extended periods away from school
- Complete immersion in white American life
- Exploitation sanctified as pedagogy

### Labor and Abuse

**Child Labor Regime**:
- Children as young as 9 given hard labor assignments
- Boys: manufacturing with leather, wood, metal
- Girls: cooking, laundry, housekeeping, fieldwork
- Compulsory labor justified as "industrial education"
- Students' work sustained the school financially

**Documented Abuse** (1928 U.S. government report):
- Children abused, overworked, underfed
- Harsh punishment for speaking Native languages
- Inadequate medical care (many students died)
- Psychological trauma from cultural suppression

## Pratt and Mike Burns: A Complex Relationship

### Historical Documentation

Mike Burns was among Carlisle's first students (September 1880-1885):
- Contributed multiple articles to *School News* (1880-1882)
- Wrote on "The Indian Question" and school anniversary
- Appeared to be a "model student" in Pratt's system
- One of the students Pratt would have cited as proof of concept

### The Terrible Questions

**Did Pratt "save" Mike Burns?**
- Mike survived Skeleton Cave; Carlisle didn't save his life
- Education gave Mike tools (literacy, English) he used to tell his story
- But at what cost? Forced separation from Yavapai culture, language, community
- Mike used the master's tools, but was that salvation or survival?

**Did Mike hate Pratt? Respect him? Both?**
- No readily available record of Mike's direct statements about Pratt
- Mike's Carlisle writings suggest he performed the role of "civilized Indian"
- Later life: Mike maintained dual identity (Hoomothya AND Mike Burns)
- The silence itself may be significant

**The paradox for Mike**:
- Pratt's system taught Mike to write
- Mike used that skill to witness against the genocide Pratt enabled
- "The Only One Living to Tell" wouldn't exist without Carlisle
- But should gratitude exist for being forced to abandon your culture to survive?

## Character Development Notes for Novel

### Characterization Challenges

**Avoid simple villainy**:
- Pratt truly believed he was helping
- He wasn't sadistic—he was ideological
- Many students remembered him with complicated feelings
- Some Indigenous leaders initially supported his approach

**Don't excuse the violence**:
- Good intentions don't erase cultural genocide
- Belief in civilization doesn't justify forced assimilation
- Kindness to individuals while destroying cultures is still destruction
- The road to genocide is paved with "we're helping you"

**Show the system, not just the man**:
- Pratt created a system that outlived him (schools ran until 1970s)
- His philosophy shaped federal Indian policy for decades
- Individual character matters less than institutional power
- Mike's struggle was with the system as much as the superintendent

### Possible Characterizations

**The True Believer**:
- Genuinely thought he was saving children
- Saw himself as enlightened compared to extermination advocates
- Kind to individual students while destroying their cultures
- The banality of systemic evil

**The Military Man**:
- Applied military discipline to cultural transformation
- Saw assimilation as a battle to be won
- Believed in order, hierarchy, American superiority
- No room for ambiguity or cultural preservation

**The Reformer's Blindness**:
- Opposed reservation system and corrupt Indian agents
- Advocated for Indian citizenship and education
- But couldn't imagine equality without erasure
- His "progressive" views required cultural death

## Key Relationship Moments for Novel

### First Encounter (September 1880)
**Mike arrives at Carlisle** (age ~15):
- Does Pratt personally greet new students?
- The hair cutting ceremony—violation witnessed or enforced by Pratt?
- Assignment of the name "Michael Burns"—who chose it?
- First English-only rule enforcement

**Mike's internal experience**:
- Already traumatized (Skeleton Cave 8 years earlier)
- Already renamed once (by Captain James Burns)
- Already torn between identities
- Now facing systematic erasure of remaining Yavapai self

### During Carlisle Years (1880-1885)

**Pratt as Authority Figure**:
- Distant superintendent or personal presence?
- Did he single out Mike as success story?
- Pressure to write articles proving assimilation worked?
- The performance of being a "good Indian" student

**Possible Direct Interactions**:
- Pratt reviewing Mike's written work?
- Commendation for Mike's progress in English?
- Discussion of Mike's future after Carlisle?
- Mike's silence hiding Hoomothya underneath?

### Adult Reflection (1934 Writing)

**Mike looking back**:
- How does he write about Pratt?
- Gratitude for education? Anger at erasure?
- Understanding Pratt's role in larger genocide?
- Reclaiming Hoomothya despite Pratt's best efforts?

## Thematic Significance

Pratt embodies:
- **Cultural genocide with a smile**: Violence disguised as salvation
- **Systemic oppression**: Individual kindness within destructive institutions
- **Forced identity**: The pressure to choose between cultural death and survival
- **Educational violence**: Learning as weapon against one's own people
- **Complicated legacy**: Mike's literacy came through cultural erasure

## For the Author: Handling Pratt in the Novel

### Do:
- Show Pratt as true believer, not sadist
- Illustrate how his "kindness" was conditional on cultural death
- Let Mike's internal conflict with Pratt's system drive character development
- Use Pratt to explore assimilation's violence
- Show the performance Mike had to maintain

### Don't:
- Make Pratt a simple villain (too easy)
- Suggest Mike should be grateful (too painful)
- Resolve the paradox neatly (Mike lived with ambiguity)
- Let Pratt's intentions excuse the system's impact
- Speak for Mike on whether Carlisle helped or harmed

### Key Questions for Mike's Journey:
- Can you use the master's tools without becoming the master?
- Is survival worth cultural erasure?
- How do you reclaim an identity systematically suppressed?
- What do you owe the institution that educated you while destroying you?

### Dramatize Through Scenes:

**Outward compliance**:
- Mike writing perfect English essays
- Mike marching in military formation
- Mike wearing the uniform
- Mike speaking only English

**Internal resistance**:
- Hoomothya's voice in Mike's head
- Yavapai words Mike whispers alone
- Memories Pratt can't erase
- The self Mike keeps hidden

**The ultimate defiance**:
- Mike uses Carlisle's literacy to witness
- He writes his story in English but from Yavapai perspective
- The education meant to erase becomes tool of resistance
- Pratt's "success story" tells the truth Pratt tried to destroy
