# General George Crook

**Full Name**: George Crook
**Life**: September 8, 1828 - March 21, 1890
**Rank**: Brigadier General (1872), later Lieutenant General
**Key Commands**: Department of Arizona (1871-1875, 1882-1886); Department of the Platte (1875-1882)
**West Point**: 1852, graduated 38th out of 43
**Friend**: Philip H. Sheridan (lifelong friend from West Point)

**Yavapai Name**: "Old Woman's Face" or "Old Woman's Eyes" (wrinkled face, small eyes)

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Mike Burns's testimony provides **PRIMARY and AUTHORITATIVE** insight into Crook's character from a Yavapai perspective and details about promises made and broken. His account complements but also challenges the military historical narrative.

General George Crook embodies one of American history's most troubling paradoxes: the military commander who destroyed Indigenous peoples while advocating for their rights; the promise-maker who broke his word; the man some Apache and Yavapai respected even as he conquered them. Mike Burns knew Crook personally across decades, and his testimony reveals both the general's complexity and his moral failings.

## Early Life and Military Career

**Born**: September 8, 1828, Taylorville, Ohio (9th of 10 children to Thomas and Elizabeth Crook)
**Father**: Farmer who emigrated from Maryland to Ohio after War of 1812
**Character**: Described as taciturn, self-confident, phlegmatic

**West Point** (1852):
- Graduated 38th out of 43—near bottom of his class
- Considered academically undistinguished, slow to learn but never had to relearn
- Made few friends; closest was Philip H. Sheridan (their careers crossed many times over 40 years)
- Upon graduation: self-assured, unflappable, emotionally remote

**Pre-Civil War Service** (1852-1861):
- 4th US Infantry as Brevet 2nd Lieutenant
- California 1852-1861
- Oregon and Northern California: fought several Native American tribes
- 1857: Severely wounded by Indian arrow in Pitt River Expedition

**Civil War**: Distinguished service

**1872**: Appointed Brigadier General—promotion that passed over and angered several full colonels

## Appearance and Style

**Later Years Description** (from APCRP):
- Great cotton-candy mounds of gray muttonchops sideburns covering most of lower face
- Strong straight nose, piercing deep-set blue eyes
- **Almost never wore uniform**—preferred overalls or canvas suit
- Conical hat (like Japanese rice farmer)
- Carried shotgun instead of standard Springfield Army rifle
- **Rode a mule named Apache**, insisted mules were superior to horses

This unconventional appearance belied his military effectiveness and won respect from soldiers who served under him.

## Arizona Service and the Winter Campaign (1871-1875)

### Appointment to Arizona (June 4, 1871)

Sent to replace General Stoneman as commander of Arizona Territory after Camp Grant Massacre (April 30, 1871). President Grant ordered two-pronged program:
1. Peace negotiations (led by one-armed Civil War officer General Oliver Howard)
2. Military force if negotiations failed

General Howard negotiated tentative peace with Cochise but could not make peace with Yavapai and Tonto Apache in central mountains, who defiantly rejected proposals.

President Grant ordered General Crook into battle—Winter Campaign 1872-73 began.

### The Winter Campaign of 1872-1873

**Strategic Approach**:
- Decided only decisive military defeat would force Apache and Yavapai onto reservations permanently
- Excuse for comprehensive war of attrition: learned of plot to kill him at Date Creek Reservation
- ~100 warriors and families fled to Skeleton Cave, fearing retaliation

**Tactical Innovation**:
- Use of Indian scouts (Apache, Pima, Maricopa) as primary weapon
- Pack mule trains for mobility in rough terrain
- Doctrine of continuous pressure—never allowing enemy rest
- Philosophy: "An Indian fighting as an Indian is an effective soldier"

**Campaign Results**:
- December 28, 1872: **Skeleton Cave Massacre** - Mike's family killed
- December 1872: Seven actions total (106 Native Americans killed)
- March 25, 1873: Turret Peak battle
- 1871-1874: 95 engagements total
- **April 27, 1873**: Last Apache and Yavapai surrendered at Camp Verde

**Mike Burns's Perspective on the Campaign**:
Mike traveled with troops after Skeleton Cave, witnessing the aftermath of Crook's "decisive" strategy—communities destroyed, people hunted relentlessly, surrender inevitable.

## Mike Burns's Testimony: Crook's Character

### "A Great General"

Mike's assessment of Crook was complex:

**Positive View**:
> Crook was "a great general," "just and kind"

Indians "thought a good deal of him." Even those he conquered respected his fairness compared to other officers.

**Why Respect?**:
- Kept his word when he gave it (initially)
- Treated surrendered peoples more humanely than other commanders
- Employed Native scouts and paid them fairly
- Later spoke out against injustices to Native Americans

**Mrs. Crook**: Mike met her at Fort Omaha in 1880 when traveling to Carlisle. She was kind to him.

### The Broken Promises: Mike's Authoritative Account

**THE PROMISE** (1873 at Camp Verde/Rio Verde):

When General Crook gathered all Yavapai and Tonto Apaches at Camp Verde/Cottonwood—approximately 3,500 people—he made a solemn promise:

> They could stay at Rio Verde "**as long as they lived**"

Mike's account makes clear this was not a vague suggestion but a specific promise Crook made repeatedly to the gathered peoples.

**THE REALITY** (1873-1875):

For about two years, they lived peacefully at Rio Verde Agency:
- Raised crops: wheat, barley, corn
- Received daily rations: flour, sugar, coffee, beans, bacon, fresh beef
- Built homes and community
- Believed Crook's promise

Then disease outbreak killed ~1,500 people. Indians believed Dr. Josephus Williams poisoned them.

**THE BETRAYAL** (February 1875):

In the latter part of February 1875, General Crook broke his promise. Approximately 2,000 Indians were forced to march from Rio Verde to San Carlos—a toilsome 20-day journey.

**The Second Promise**:
Crook said they could return in **5-7 years**

**Mike's Testament**:
> "General Crook's fine promises, however, were never carried out."

They never returned to Rio Verde. The 5-7 year promise was a lie to make them walk peacefully to exile.

### Impact on Mike's View

**The Contradiction**: Mike called Crook "a great general" and "just and kind" while also documenting his broken promises. This wasn't naiveté—it was Mike's mature understanding that:
- Crook could be personally fair while enforcing brutal policy
- Individual kindness doesn't erase systematic betrayal
- Crook was better than many officers, which made his betrayal worse
- The system itself was the problem, but Crook chose to serve it

## After Arizona: Advocacy and Continued Service

### Department of the Platte (1875-1882)

**Transferred**: 1874, Commander of Department of the Platte
**Headquarters**: Fort Omaha, Nebraska (where Mike met Mrs. Crook in 1880)

**Sioux Wars** (1876-1877):
- Great Sioux War
- Mike Burns participated as young boy with Fifth Cavalry under General Merritt
- Mike's account provides ground-level view of campaign Crook commanded

**Later Advocacy**:
Crook began speaking out on behalf of Native American rights. Indians cried when they learned of his death in 1890, according to Mike—testament to complex legacy.

### Return to Arizona (1882-1886)

**1882**: Back in command in Arizona

**Geronimo Campaign** (1885-1886):
- Mike Burns served as Army scout during this period
- Crook's relationship with Geronimo became legendary

**Canon de los Embudos** (March 1886):
- Geronimo met with Crook, agreed to surrender
- Convinced Crook would kill him, Geronimo gathered warriors and slipped away
- General Phil Sheridan questioned Crook for placing too much trust in Geronimo
- **Crook resigned** rather than accept criticism
- Replaced by General Nelson Miles (egotistical, politically ambitious, took false credit for eventual Geronimo capture)

### Late Career Advocacy

**Growing Sympathy**: Later years saw Crook increasingly speak out against unjust treatment of Indians

**Quote Associated with Him** (via friend Sheridan):
General Philip Sheridan reportedly said: "The only good Indians I ever saw were dead." Sheridan repeatedly denied saying it, but was known as bigot and Indian hater. The contrast with Crook's evolving views is notable.

**Death**: March 21, 1890, Chicago, from heart failure, still on active duty

**Mike's Note**: Indians cried when they learned of his death—they remembered his later advocacy even if they couldn't forget his earlier campaigns.

## Critical Controversies

### "Soft Approach" Criticism

**The Tombstone Epitaph** and other Arizona papers hated Crook for his "soft" approach and "curious refusal to go for the kill when his troops seemed to have the renegades boxed in."

Papers suggested Crook had fallen "dangerously under the sway of 'hypocritical kid-gloved philosophers' of the East" and that "New England humanitarians" had made him soft.

**The Accusation**: When Geronimo remained loose in 1886, papers blamed Crook's "mismanagement," costing him "not only advancement in rank but a large share of his reputation as an Indian fighter."

**The Irony**: These same papers would likely have called the Skeleton Cave Massacre a great success. Crook was criticized for being too brutal by some (Native peoples) and too soft by others (Arizona settlers).

### Historical Assessment

**San Francisco Chronicle** (1886): "His mismanagement of the Apache campaign has cost him not only advancement in rank but a large share of his reputation as an Indian fighter."

**Charles Lummis** (Los Angeles Times reporter): Noted Crook was "reviled by many Arizonans" despite his earlier reputation as ruthless Indian fighter. His growing sympathy toward Native peoples was seen as betrayal by settlers who wanted extermination.

## The Moral Paradox: Promise-Maker and Promise-Breaker

### What Mike's Testimony Reveals

**Crook's Promises**:
1. "As long as they lived" at Rio Verde (1873) → **Broken in 1875**
2. "Return in 5-7 years" to Verde Valley (1875) → **Never kept**

**The Pattern**:
- Crook made promises he believed would bring peace
- System/policy forced him to break those promises
- He chose to enforce policy over keeping word

**Mike's Complex View**:
Mike didn't call Crook evil. He called him "a great general" and "just and kind" while documenting the broken promises. This suggests:
- Mike understood Crook was trapped between duty and decency
- Crook was better than most officers—which made betrayal more painful
- Personal character doesn't excuse broken promises to thousands

### The Unanswerable Questions

**Did Crook know he was lying?**
- Did he make promises in good faith, believing he could keep them?
- Or did he know they were tactical lies to prevent resistance?

**Did he feel guilt?**
- His later advocacy suggests he did
- But advocacy didn't bring Yavapais back to Rio Verde

**Can sympathy coexist with destruction?**
- Crook proved it can—he genuinely cared while enforcing genocide
- The question is whether that matters to those destroyed

## For the Novel: Crook as Character

### Key Scenes to Develop

1. **The Promise** (1873): Crook addressing gathered Yavapais and Tontos at Rio Verde. Speaking through interpreters. The weight of "as long as they lived." People believing him.

2. **The Betrayal** (February 1875): Orders coming down. Crook knowing he's breaking his word. Does he believe the 5-7 year promise himself? Or is it a calculated lie?

3. **Mike's Encounter** (possible): If Mike met Crook during scout service or later—the survivor facing the promise-breaker.

4. **Crook's Later Advocacy**: News reaching Mike that Crook is speaking for Indian rights. Mike's complex feelings—vindication? Anger? Too late?

5. **Death** (1890): Mike learning Crook died. Indians crying. Mike's own tears—for what? The man who destroyed his world? The man who later tried to make amends? Both?

### Character Complexity

**Crook cannot be**:
- Simple villain
- Noble tragic hero
- Redeemed by late-life advocacy

**Crook must be**:
- Genuinely capable of kindness and fairness
- Genuinely responsible for broken promises and death
- Complex enough that Mike could respect him while knowing what he did
- Self-aware enough to feel guilt, not self-aware enough to refuse orders

### The Novel's Judgment

**Don't let Crook off the hook**: Late-life advocacy doesn't erase broken promises or Skeleton Cave

**Don't make him simple**: He was complex—that's what makes him dangerous. Simple villains are easy to identify. Men like Crook—decent, respected, "just and kind"—commit atrocities while believing they're doing their duty.

**Trust Mike's View**: Mike knew Crook personally across decades. His assessment—complex, contradictory—is authoritative.

## Relationship with Mike Burns Across Time

### Direct Interactions (Documented)

**1873-1875**: Crook as distant commander. Mike too young to understand the general's role.

**1876**: Mike accompanied Fifth Cavalry during Sioux War. Crook commanded overall campaign. Unknown if they met directly.

**1880**: Mike met Mrs. Crook at Fort Omaha when traveling to Carlisle. She was kind. Suggests Crook may have known about Mike.

**1885-1887**: Mike served as Army scout during Geronimo campaign. Crook commanded Arizona 1882-1886. Possible direct encounter.

### Indirect Connection

**The Inescapable Reality**: Even when not present, Crook shaped Mike's life:
- His orders killed Mike's family
- His promises created hope
- His betrayal forced exile
- His scout policy employed Mike
- His advocacy (too late) tried to help

Mike couldn't escape Crook's shadow—the general's decisions echoed through Mike's entire life.

## Thematic Significance

Crook embodies the novel's core themes:

**Moral Complexity Without Excuse**:
- People can be kind and destructive
- Good intentions don't erase bad outcomes
- Individual decency doesn't absolve systematic violence

**Broken Promises**:
- "As long as they lived" becomes 2 years
- "5-7 years" becomes never
- Pattern of American treaty-breaking

**The Survivor's Burden**:
- Mike had to navigate world shaped by Crook's choices
- Respect the man while knowing what he did
- Work for army commanded by family's destroyer

**Witness and Testimony**:
- Mike's account corrects hagiographic histories
- Crook was complex—Mike documents both kindness and betrayal
- Historical truth requires Indigenous testimony
