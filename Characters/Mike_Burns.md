# Mike Burns (Hoomothya)

**Birth Name**: Hoomothya ("Wet Nose")
**English Names**: Mickie, Mike Burns, Michael Burns
**Born**: c. 1864-1865, near Four Peaks Mountains, Arizona Territory
**Tribe**: Kwevkepaya (branch of Yavapai), later identified as Apache Mojave
**Died**: November 26, 1934, Fort McDowell, Arizona (age ~69-70)

**Mike Burns** was a Yavapai survivor of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, U.S. Army scout, and author whose life spanned two worlds. He is "the only one living to tell" the truth of what happened to his people on December 28, 1872. His autobiography, finally published in 2012 as "The Only One Living to Tell," stands as an essential primary source document and a powerful testament to witness, survival, and the moral complexities of forced assimilation.

## Early Life (c. 1864-1872)

### Birth and Childhood
Born Hoomothya (meaning "Wet Nose") around 1864-1865 near the Four Peaks Mountains in Arizona Territory. His birthplace was in the heart of Yavapai territory, an area he later described as one of "great beauty and happiness."

**Yavapai Heritage**: Kwevkepaya branch of the Yavapai people. The Yavapai were distinct from Apache, though often misidentified by Americans. They spoke a Yuman language (not Athapaskan like Apache) and had their own cultural practices, though considerable mixing with Western Apache had occurred by the 1860s.

**Geographic Home**: Four Peaks Mountains area (Yavapai name: **Weegajochehaw** - "the mountain that has been chopped up"), Salt River Canyon, Superstition Mountains (Yavapai name: **Wee-git-a-sour-ha** - "a rock looking up").

### Family

**Before the Massacre**:
- **Mother**: Killed by soldiers c. 1869 (when Mike was ~5), a few miles east of Mormon Flat. "She ran for her life and crawled in a rock hole. She was pulled out and shot many times."
- **Father**: After mother's death, became "bitter enemy of the Hayko (enemy)," often went to Salt River Valley to kill whites. Killed at Skeleton Cave December 28, 1872.
- **Little Brother**: Mike cared for him after mother's death. Killed at Skeleton Cave.
- **Baby Sister**: About 3 years old. Mike cared for her after mother's death. Killed at Skeleton Cave.
- **Grandfather**: Killed at Skeleton Cave. Mike saw his body: "had part of his head in a little rock hole."
- **Aunt**: Killed at Skeleton Cave with her 5 children.
- **Uncle**: Killed at Skeleton Cave.
- **Brother-in-law**: Last person killed at Skeleton Cave. "Shot through bowels with gun bent nearly double. He was never known to have ever missed a shot. He was the last one to be killed, and he was killed like a man."
- **Uncle** (separate): Deserted Mike when soldiers came, December 22, 1872. Mike was sent with him to Wipuk (Sedona area) to retrieve a horse.

**Surviving Relatives (Found Later)**:
- **Cousin Cealiah/Worthless** (female): Married to Jutahamaka (Swift Hawk, medicine man), had 6 children. One of 6 women away from cave morning of massacre gathering mescal. Mike found her at San Carlos 1885—she died shortly after.
- **Cousin Quaknidueyah/Summer Deer/James Roberts** (male): Parents killed by Maricopas/Pimas when he was baby. Recognized Mike at San Carlos like "a ghost come back from the dead." Later went to Carlisle.
- **Dr. Carlos Montezuma/Wassaja** (distant cousin): Captured as baby, sold to photographer Mr. Gentile, became medical doctor in Chicago, outspoken Indian rights leader. Died 1923, buried Fort McDowell. Mike corresponded with him.

### Mother's Death (c. 1869)

When Mike was about 5 years old, his mother was killed by soldiers on patrol. This traumatic event fundamentally altered the family:
- Mike's father became consumed with hatred of whites
- Mike, at age 5, became primary caretaker for his younger brother and baby sister
- The children Mike raised would die at Skeleton Cave three years later

## Capture and the Massacre (December 1872)

### Capture (December 22, 1872)

**The Setting**: Near Four Peaks Mountains, elevation ~7,645 feet. Heavy snow, bitter cold.

**The Abandonment**: Mike's uncle was taking him to Wipuk (Sedona area) to retrieve a horse. When soldiers appeared, his uncle deserted him, fleeing without the seven-year-old boy.

**The Night in the Rock Hole**:
- Mike hid in a rock hole wearing only a G-string
- Soldiers camped nearby
- Temperature well below freezing, snowstorm
- Nearly froze to death
- Alone, terrified, convinced he would die

> "I was only a few miles away from them. How I got through that freezing night is a miracle."

**The Capture**: The next morning, December 22, 1872, Mike emerged from the rock hole and was captured by soldiers. He fought valiantly but was overpowered—"they pulled me over rocks and bushes. The men didn't care whether I got hurt or not."

Taken to **Captain James Burns**. Lieutenant E.D. Thomas recorded the capture date.

### The Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)

**Six days after capture**, Mike was forced to witness the massacre of his family and people.

**Location**: Cave on north side of Salt River at mouth of Fish Creek (near where Horseshoe Dam is now).

**Victims**: Approximately **225 people** according to Mike's eyewitness testimony (Army records claim 54-76).

**Led by**: Captain James Burns according to Mike (secondary sources say Captain William H. Brown—Mike's version is authoritative as eyewitness).

**What Mike Witnessed**:
> "My people thought that they were strongly protected and could not see to shoot the soldiers. But the soldiers were ordered to shoot down volleys of buckets of lead behind those big boulders, so that the walls of the cave would scatter the glancing bullets into the people beneath. **The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans. The war songs ceased.**"

**His Family Killed**:
- Father
- Grandfather ("had part of his head in a little rock hole")
- Little brother (whom Mike had cared for)
- Baby sister (~3 years old, whom Mike had cared for)
- Aunt with 5 children
- Uncle
- Brother-in-law (last to die, "killed like a man")

**The Brutality After**:
Pima and Maricopa scouts rushed in after shooting stopped and crushed the heads of wounded survivors with rocks. One wounded woman was left with food/water but later "smashed her head to jelly" by Pimas when soldiers left.

**Mike's Moral Crisis**:
> "What would I do? Should I give myself up to the Pimas and Maricopas to be killed there with my family? Should I forget those awful deeds against my people and take on a new and manly courage, resolve to be a different man and hope for a better future?"

**His Testament**:
> "In all history no civilized race has murdered another as the American soldiers did my people in the year 1872."

> "**I am the only one living to tell what happened to my people.**"

> "It is a mysterious thing, the fact that I am alive to tell how I was saved, while every last one of my tribe was killed."

### The Moral Complexity

Mike served as scout against his own people and other Native Americans. This created profound moral conflict:
- He was helping the Army that massacred his family
- He was tracking other Native peoples fighting for freedom
- He needed to survive in a world that had destroyed his old life
- His education and military service were tools of assimilation—yet also tools he would later use to tell his people's truth

---

## Return and Recognition at San Carlos (December 1885)

**The Reunion**: When Mike returned to San Carlos in December 1885, his cousin Quaknidueyah (Summer Deer/James Roberts) recognized him—"like a ghost come back from the dead."

Mike had to speak to his own people through an interpreter. He had lost much of his Yavapai language during 13 years among whites.

**Finding Cealiah**: Mike found his cousin Cealiah (Worthless), married to medicine man Jutahamaka (Swift Hawk), with 6 children. She was one of 6 women away from the cave the morning of the massacre. She died shortly after their reunion.

**The Weight of Return**: Coming home meant confronting loss, recognizing how much had been taken, how much he had changed.

---

**Work**: Woodcutter and rancher near Fort McDowell.

---

## Writing and the Struggle to Publish (1910-1934)

### The Mission

Mike spent the last decades of his life trying to tell the truth about what happened to his people. His determination to publish his manuscript was driven by a deep moral obligation:

> "I am going to tell the White People that they have heard only one side of the stories about how bad the Apaches were to the whites. But the Apaches were forced to be so and they tried to protect themselves, their homes and their land. And who would not do the same thing?"

### Timeline of Manuscript

**1910**: Began correspondence with Sharlot Hall seeking publication help.

**January 7, 1913**: Wrote to Carlos Montezuma about telling the Apache side of the story.

**1922**: Gave manuscript to Dr. William H. Corbusier (surgeon at Camp Date Creek) for editing. Corbusier edited but removed Mike's "charges against Anglos." Publishers rejected it.

**Spring 1929**: Delivered manuscript draft to Sharlot Hall. She edited a few pages but made **no effort to publish**.

**1910-1934**: Decades of rejection, indifference, and broken promises from white editors and publishers.

### Captain John Gregory Bourke Incident

Mike helped Bourke with research for "On the Border with Crook"—talked to old Indians about traditional life, foods, customs. Bourke promised Mike share of money from book. Book was published 1891. **Mike never received payment**—another broken promise.

---

## Final Years and Death

**May 28, 1934**: Moved to Fort McDowell Indian Reservation

**November 26, 1934**: Died at Fort McDowell, age ~69-70

**Burial**: Fort McDowell Cemetery

**Manuscript Fate**: Stored in fragments at Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona until 2002.

**2010-2012**: Manuscript finally published as "All My People Were Killed" (2010) and "The Only One Living to Tell" (2012) by University of Arizona Press—**76-78 years after his death**.

---

## Legacy and Historical Significance

### Primary Source Authority

Mike Burns's manuscript is the **only first-person eyewitness account** of the Skeleton Cave Massacre. His testimony is the authoritative source on:
- What actually happened at Skeleton Cave
- The number of victims (~225, not 54-76)
- The brutality of Pima/Maricopa scouts
- The deaths of specific individuals including Chief Delshe
- The emotional and psychological impact on survivors

### Voice and Literary Power

Mike's writing is direct, unflinching, occasionally poetic. His voice carries moral authority born of witness:
> "Good-bye my homeland, and water, and trees and rocks. There is no chance that I shall live long enough to come back to this land."

> "Anyone who has had to live by himself in the world knows what it is like to have no one to help when he is in need."

> "I have come to the conclusion that the mind of man changes, but the country never changes."

### Historical Corrective

Mike's testimony corrects the historical record on critical facts:
- Highland University location: Kansas, NOT New Mexico
- Chief Delshe's fate: killed at Skeleton Cave, did NOT surrender later
- Duration of scout service: intermittent 1885-1887, NOT "30 years"
- Casualty count at Skeleton Cave: ~225, NOT 54-76

### Themes

**Survival and Witness**: The burden and obligation of being "the only one living to tell"

**Identity and Displacement**: Hoomothya → Mike Burns. Living between two worlds, belonging to neither.

**Broken Promises**: Crook's promises, Christian community's refusal, publishers' indifference, Bourke's unpaid debt.

**Loss and Memory**: Individual losses (family) and collective loss (homeland, culture, language). Writing as resistance to erasure.

**Moral Complexity**: Scout service, education as assimilation vs. tool of testimony, survival vs. preservation.

## For the Novel: Mike's Character Arc

### Act I: Hoomothya (1864-1872)
Innocent child in Yavapai world → Mother's death → Caretaker at age 5 → Abandonment and capture → Forced witness to genocide

### Act II: Mike Burns (1872-1908)
Adoption → Military life → Education → Scout service → Moral complexity → Return to San Carlos → Marriage and family

### Act III: The Witness (1908-1934)
Writing the manuscript → Decades of rejection → Determination to tell truth → Death with story untold → Final vindication 76 years later

### Core Internal Conflict

Mike lived with impossible contradictions:
- Loved by the man who massacred his family (Captain Burns)
- Educated by the system designed to erase his culture
- Served the Army that destroyed his people
- Survived when everyone he loved died
- Remembered everything in two languages and neither felt like home

His life asks profound questions: What does it mean to survive? What do we owe the dead? How do we live with unbearable memory? How do we tell the truth when no one wants to hear it?
