# The Life of Mike Burns (Hoomothya)

**Mike Burns**, born **Hoomothya** around 1864, was a significant figure in Native American history, a survivor of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, a U.S. Army scout, and the author of an insightful autobiography. His life bridged the tumultuous gap between the Yavapai people and the encroaching American society.

## Early Life and the Skeleton Cave Massacre

Hoomothya was a young Yavapai boy living in Arizona during a period of intense conflict between Native Americans and the United States. His life was irrevocably changed on December 28, 1872, by the **Skeleton Cave Massacre** (also known as the Battle of Salt River Canyon).

The massacre was a brutal event in the Yavapai War. A band of Yavapai, including many women and children, had sought refuge in a large cave in the Salt River Canyon. They were discovered by U.S. Army soldiers from the 5th Cavalry, led by Captain James Burns, along with Pima and Apache scouts. The soldiers surrounded the cave and, after the Yavapai refused to surrender, opened fire and rolled boulders onto the cave entrance. An estimated 76 to 100 Yavapai were killed.

Tragically, the young Hoomothya was captured by the soldiers and forced to lead them to the cave where his family and people were camped. He was a direct witness to the slaughter of his family.

## Life After the Massacre and as a U.S. Army Scout

In a strange twist of fate, Hoomothya was adopted by Captain James Burns, the very officer who had led the attack on his people. He was given the name **Mike Burns**.

He would go on to serve as a scout for the U.S. Army, a role that placed him in the complex position of working for the same military that had destroyed his family. His knowledge of the land and his people was a valuable asset to the army during the ongoing Indian Wars of the 1880s.

## "The Only One Living to Tell"

Before his death in 1934, Mike Burns wrote his autobiography, a manuscript that would remain unpublished for decades. The manuscript was archived at the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott, Arizona.

In 2012, the University of Arizona Press published his autobiography under the title **"The Only One Living to Tell."** The book is a rare and invaluable firsthand account of the Skeleton Cave Massacre, his experiences as an army scout, and the culture and lifeways of the Kwevkepaya and Tolkepaya Yavapai.

His autobiography offers a unique and powerful perspective on a critical period in Arizona's history, told from the viewpoint of a man who had experienced its most brutal and contradictory aspects.

## Legacy

Mike Burns's life story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable trauma. His autobiography ensures that the story of the Skeleton Cave Massacre and the Yavapai people is not forgotten. He remains a vital voice in the history of the American West, a man who lived in two worlds and left a powerful account of his journey.
