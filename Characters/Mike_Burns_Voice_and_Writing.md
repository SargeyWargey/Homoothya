## Mike Burns's Actual Words (Direct Quotes)

### On the Massacre (Written 1913):
> "There is no history of a civilized race that they have murdered one another as the American soldiers had done to my people in the year of 1872. They have slaughtered men, women, and children without mercy... **I am the only one living now to tell about what happened to my people.**"

### On His Mother's Death:
> "I could remember when my mother was killed by the soldiers a few miles east of Mormon Flat... From that time my father had bitter vengeance for soldiers and all the white people because the way the soldiers had treated my mother."

### On His Mission (Letter to Sharlot Hall):
> "I am going to tell the White People that they have heard only one side of the stories about how bad the Apaches were to the whites."

> Wrote to Sharlot Hall seeking "a little history of the Apaches... including my own history"

## Voice Characteristics

### Writing Style
- **Direct and unflinching**: Doesn't soften the truth about violence and loss
- **Witness stance**: "I am the only one living now to tell" - sense of responsibility
- **Personal and intimate**: Uses "my people," "my mother," "my father" - deeply personal
- **Clear moral vision**: Recognizes injustice without equivocation
- **Historical consciousness**: Aware he's providing perspective that's been silenced

### Emotional Tone
- **Grief mixed with purpose**: Loss drives the need to witness
- **Righteous anger**: "bitter vengeance" - acknowledges rage without apologizing for it
- **Pride in heritage**: Wants to tell Native perspectives with dignity
- **Lived between worlds**: "at home in neither" - profound displacement
- **Storyteller's awareness**: Conscious of providing "the other side"

### Narrative Approach
- **Not an "as told to" story**: Burns wrote himself - literate, educated voice
- **Part eyewitness, part oral historian, part ethnographer, all storyteller**
- **Factual but emotionally charged**: Specific details (dates, places) combined with emotional truth
- **Personal history as collective witness**: His story represents his people's experience

## Key Themes in His Writing

1. **Massacre as defining trauma**: "all my people were killed" - total loss
2. **Forced assimilation**: Renamed, re-educated, serving the army that killed his family
3. **Cultural in-betweenness**: Living in two worlds, accepted by neither
4. **Duty to witness**: Compulsion to tell the untold stories
5. **Complexity of survival**: Scout service, education - survival required moral compromise
6. **Preserving heritage**: Writing as act of cultural preservation

## Critical Reception Insights

### What Reviewers Say About His Voice:
- **Booklist**: "Hidden in archives for decades... a compelling account"
- **Kirkus Reviews**: "potency and immediacy of the observations"
- **Margot Mifflin**: "a crucial piece of American history"
- **Common thread**: Power comes from firsthand perspective, immediacy, authenticity

### Unique Perspective:
- **Rare Native American account** of the Skeleton Cave Massacre
- **Insider view** of Native-white relations during westward expansion
- **Complex position**: "Orphan, captive, servant, scout, and witness"
- **Lived experience** trumps secondhand accounts

## Story Gold: Details for Novel

### Emotional Turning Points to Explore:
1. **Mother's death** - shaped father's "bitter vengeance," Mike witnessed it
2. **Being forced to lead soldiers to cave** - "frightened, alone, and a prisoner"
3. **The massacre itself** - "slaughtered men, women, and children without mercy"
4. **Name change** - Hoomothya ("Wet Nose") â†’ Mike Burns
5. **Between-worlds isolation** - never fully accepted by whites or Native Americans
6. **Writing as reclamation** - 60+ years later, finally telling his truth

### Sensory/Human Details Mentioned:
- **Geographic specificity**: Salt River Canyon, Mormon Flat, cave-rancheria
- **Age at trauma**: 7-8 years old (young enough to remember, old enough to understand)
- **Physical journey**: Led soldiers to the cave where his family would die
- **Carlisle experience**: Learned to read and write there
- **Scout service**: Witnessed Little Bighorn campaign, rode against Sitting Bull and Geronimo
- **Final years**: Retired to Fort McDowell Reservation, died 1934

### Questions His Writing Raises (Gaps for Fiction):
- What did "frightened, alone, and a prisoner" actually feel like for an 8-year-old?
- How did he experience the days between capture (Dec 22) and massacre (Dec 28)?
- What was it like to write this story 40+ years later, knowing no one would publish it?
- How did he reconcile scouting for the army that killed his family?
- What specific memories of his mother haunted him?
- What did "Hoomothya" (Wet Nose) mean to him before it was taken away?
