**Purpose**: Deep character understanding for first-person narration - who Mike is emotionally, psychologically, spiritually across his life.

## CORE IDENTITY

### The Central Contradiction
Mike Burns lives at the intersection of **impossible identities**:
- Hoomothya AND Mike Burns
- Yavapai survivor AND Army scout
- Victim AND "adopted son" of his family's killer
- Assimilated AND culturally rooted
- Educated AND silenced
- Citizen AND outsider

**This tension drives everything.** He is never fully one thing or another. He exists in the devastating space between worlds.

### Internal Conflicts
1. **Gratitude vs. Rage** toward Captain Burns
2. **Yavapai identity vs. American citizenship**
3. **Survivor vs. Witness** (living for self vs. duty to dead)
4. **Silence vs. Truth** (safety in silence, danger in speaking)

## RELATIONSHIPS: THE PEOPLE WHO SHAPED HIM

### Family (All Lost in 1872)

**Mother** (name unknown, killed before Skeleton Cave)
- Warm, protective presence in early childhood
- Her death created father's "bitter vengeance"
- Mike's memory: Her voice, her hands, the way she smiled?
- Loss: First experience of soldier violence

**Father** (name unknown, killed at Skeleton Cave)
- Loving parent transformed by grief/rage
- "Bitter vengeance for soldiers and all the white people"
- Protected family, chose cave refuge, died trying to save them
- Mike's memory: Father's anger, his attempts to keep family safe, his death

**Extended Family** (aunts, uncles, cousins - all killed at Skeleton Cave)

- Elders telling stories, teaching ways
- Cousins to play with, learn alongside
- All lost in one day

**Community** (Kwevkepaya Yavapai)
- Cultural foundation, sense of belonging
- Seasonal migrations, traditional practices
- Language, stories, worldview
- Shattered December 28, 1872

### Captain James Burns (Adoptive Father / Family's Killer)

**The impossible relationship** - most complex in Mike's life

**Burns's perspective (likely)**:
- Saw himself as savior, civilizer
- Genuine affection? Or paternalistic duty?
- Guilt over massacre? Or justified military action?
- Pride in Mike's education? Or satisfaction in assimilation?

**Mike's experience**:
- Gratitude (kept me alive) + Rage (killed my family)
- Father figure (raised me) + Enemy (destroyed my world)
- Provider (education, shelter) + Oppressor (cultural erasure)
- Can never escape this contradiction
- Burns's death: Relief? Grief? Emptiness? (Unknown when Burns died)

**For novel**: This relationship is emotional center of Act I-II transition

### Richard Henry Pratt (Carlisle Superintendent)

**The architect of cultural genocide**

**Pratt's philosophy**: "Kill the Indian, save the man"
- Believed assimilation was mercy
- Saw Native cultures as inferior, doomed
- Education as salvation through erasure

**Mike's experience**:
- Heard his identity declared dead
- Benefited from education Pratt provided
- Hated the philosophy, used the tools
- Complex: can despise the man, value the literacy?

**For novel**: Pratt represents systematic oppression vs. Burns's personal complexity

### Carlisle Students (Fellow Survivors)

**Shared trauma, shared resistance**

**Likely relationships**:
- Other Yavapai/Apache students: Shared language, culture, grief
- Students from other tribes: Learning Native diversity, shared oppression
- Secret moments: Speaking forbidden languages, sharing stories, resistance

**Potential characters for novel**:
- A best friend who doesn't survive (disease, despair, escape?)
- A romantic interest? (Possible but undocumented)
- A rival who embraces assimilation fully (contrast to Mike)

**For novel**: These relationships show Mike he's not alone, but also that survival looks different for each person

### Soldiers & Scouts (Scout Service Years)

**The men he served with/against**

**White soldiers**:
- Majority: Casual racism, slurs, exclusion
- Minority: Basic decency, moments of humanity
- All: Reminders he'll never fully belong

**Fellow Indian scouts**:
- Shared compromise, shared guilt
- Understanding without words?
- Drinking? Silence? Camaraderie in damnation?

**For novel**: These relationships deepen moral conflict, show gradations of complicity

### Sharlot Hall (Historian, Would-Be Publisher)

**The one who tried to help**

**Hall's role**:
- Territorial historian
- Mike wrote to her January 6, 1910
- Couldn't find publisher, but preserved manuscript
- Kept his words safe for future

**Mike's experience**:
- Hope when he wrote to her
- Disappointment when no publication came
- Gratitude that she preserved his work?
- Did they correspond over years? Unknown

**For novel**: Hall represents Mike's hope for being heard, and his acceptance that truth survives even without publication

### Fort McDowell Community (Final Years)

**Coming home to his people**

**The community**:
- Yavapai survivors and descendants
- Traditional practices maintained despite everything
- Mike's role: Elder? Storyteller? Outsider who came back?

**Mike's experience**:
- Reconnection after decades
- Acceptance? Judgment? Both?
- Peace in being among Yavapai again
- Final months: Writing, community, preparing for death

**For novel**: This represents resolution - not perfect, but real. Mike dies among his people.

## VOICE: HOW MIKE SPEAKS/THINKS ACROSS TIME

### Childhood Hoomothya (to age 8)
- Simple, sensory, immediate
- "The mesquite beans tasted sweet. Mother smiled."
- Wonder, curiosity, trust
- Present tense feeling

### Young Mike (8-15, with Burns)
- Careful, observant, guarded
- "I watched the captain's face. I had learned when to speak."
- Survival calculation
- Divided self (Hoomothya inside, Mike outside)

### Student Mike (15-21, Carlisle/Highland)
- Increasingly sophisticated, educated vocabulary
- "They told us we must kill the Indian to save the man. I wondered: which part of me would die? Which would live?"
- Code-switching between formal English and Yavapai thoughts
- Analytical, questioning

### Scout Mike (20-23)
- Clipped, military, emotionally restrained
- "I tracked them for three days. When I found them, I looked away."
- Compartmentalized - action without feeling
- Guilt underneath precision

### Searching Mike (24-43)
- Reflective, seeking, articulating contradictions
- "I had been citizen and captive, student and scout, Hoomothya and Mike Burns. I did not know which name to answer to."
- Beginning witness voice
- Questions without easy answers

### Elder Mike (43-69, **NOVEL'S PRIMARY VOICE**)
- Powerful, direct, unflinching
- "I am the only one living to tell. So I will tell."
- Mature perspective, full arc of life visible
- Specific memories rendered with sensory immediacy
- Moral clarity without self-righteousness
- Urgent - time is short, truth must be preserved

**Novel's voice should sound like Mike at 69, looking back across his life, writing at Fort McDowell in 1934, knowing he's dying, determined to witness.**
