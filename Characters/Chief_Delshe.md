# Chief Delshe (Delche, Delchay)

**Name Variations**: Delshe, Delche, Delchay
**Tribe**: Yavapai
**Territory**: Four Peaks and Superstition Mountains area
**Status**: Great warrior chief
**Death**: December 28, 1872, Skeleton Cave Massacre

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Mike Burns's eyewitness testimony is **AUTHORITATIVE** regarding Chief Delshe's fate. Mike states Delshe was killed at Skeleton Cave. Secondary sources incorrectly claim he survived and surrendered later. **Mike's version takes precedence as primary source.**

Chief Delshe was a great Yavapai warrior whose territory encompassed the Four Peaks and Superstition Mountains. He had fought "all kinds of people" and was "always victorious before" Skeleton Cave. On December 28, 1872, he led his people in their final stand—approximately 225 men, women, and children sheltering in a cave they believed impregnable. Delshe told them to get behind the big rocks at the cave entrance, convinced no enemy would dare attack their fortified position. He was wrong. The soldiers came, and Delshe died with his people in the cave that became their tomb.

## Leadership and Territory

### The Warrior Chief

**Reputation**:
Mike Burns described Delshe as a **"great warrior"** who had fought successfully against many enemies. He was a chief whose military prowess had protected his people across years of conflict.

**Territory**:
Chief Delshe's domain was the rugged, defensible country of:
- **Four Peaks Mountains** (Yavapai name: **Weegajochehaw** - "the mountain that has been chopped up")
- **Superstition Mountains** (Yavapai name: **Wee-git-a-sour-ha** - "a rock looking up")
- Salt River Canyon area
- The remote, boulder-strewn wilderness of central Arizona

This was harsh country—perfect for guerrilla warfare, impossible for conventional military pursuit, rich in defensive positions like Skeleton Cave.

**Leadership Style**:
Based on Mike's account and the circumstances, Delshe appears to have been:
- Tactically astute (chose Skeleton Cave as refuge)
- Confident in his military judgment ("always victorious before")
- Protective of his people (gathered ~225 people under his protection)
- Courageous (made final stand rather than surrender)

## The Decision to Seek Refuge

### Why Skeleton Cave?

**Timing**: December 1872, during General George Crook's Winter Campaign

**Context**:
After a plot to kill General Crook at Date Creek Reservation was discovered (or alleged), approximately 100 warriors and their families fled, fearing retaliation. Chief Delshe led them to Skeleton Cave.

**The Strategic Calculation**:
Delshe chose Skeleton Cave because:
- **Natural fortress**: Rock shelter with defensible entrance
- **Previous success**: The cave had protected Yavapai for generations
- **Access difficulty**: Steep climb, hidden location, boulder protection
- **Water and supplies**: Ability to withstand siege
- **Tactical advantage**: Defenders could shoot from cover while attackers exposed

**The Flaw**:
What Delshe didn't anticipate:
- Ricochet fire tactics (bullets bouncing off cave ceiling)
- Boulders rolled from above
- Complete military commitment to massacre rather than siege
- Betrayal by scouts who knew the terrain

---

## The Final Stand (December 28, 1872)

### Delshe's Last Command

**The Moment**:
When soldiers approached, Chief Delshe gave crucial tactical orders:

**Mike's Account**:
> Delshe "told people to get behind big rocks at cave front so soldiers couldn't see them"

**The Logic**:
This was sound defensive strategy:
- Use the large boulders outside cave entrance as cover
- Create defensive position with clear fields of fire
- Make direct assault costly for attackers
- Force soldiers to expose themselves to reach the cave

**What He Didn't Know**:
The soldiers wouldn't attack directly. They would:
- Position themselves above and around the cave
- Use ricochet fire off cave walls and ceiling
- Roll boulders down from above
- Turn the defensive positions into death traps

### The Battle

**Delshe's Perspective** (imagined from Mike's account):
- Believed his fortified position was strong
- Thought no enemy would dare attack
- Expected to repel assault or force negotiation
- Never imagined the level of slaughter to come

**The Reality**:
> "The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans. The war songs ceased."

Chief Delshe died in the cave. The great warrior who had "always been victorious before" fell with approximately 225 of his people.

## Mike Burns's Testimony vs. Historical Record

### The Critical Contradiction

**MIKE BURNS (PRIMARY SOURCE - AUTHORITATIVE)**:
- Chief Delshe **WAS at Skeleton Cave**
- Chief Delshe **WAS KILLED** at Skeleton Cave December 28, 1872
- Mike witnessed this as eyewitness

**SECONDARY SOURCES (APCRP, military records)**:
- Claim Delshe was NOT at Skeleton Cave
- Claim General Crook sought him but he wasn't there
- Claim Delshe survived and surrendered later
- Claim his 125 warriors were reduced to 20 after six months warfare
- Claim he surrendered and complained about the relentless campaign

**RESOLUTION**:
Mike Burns is the **only eyewitness** who left a detailed account. He was there. He was forced to watch. He saw Chief Delshe's band destroyed. **His testimony is authoritative.**

### Why the Discrepancy?

**Possible Explanations**:

1. **Multiple Chiefs Named Delshe/Delche**: Perhaps there were two different leaders with similar names—one killed at Skeleton Cave, one who survived. This seems unlikely.

2. **Military Records Error**: The Army may have confused different Yavapai bands or leaders. They often misidentified tribes and leaders.

3. **Propaganda**: Military may have wanted to claim they captured the "great chief" alive rather than massacred him with women and children.

4. **Mike's Memory**: Could Mike have misremembered who led the band at Skeleton Cave? Unlikely—he was specific about Delshe's presence and death.

5. **Conflation in Secondary Sources**: Later historians may have combined different events or confused different chiefs.

**For the Novel**:
Trust Mike. He was there. Chief Delshe died at Skeleton Cave.

## The Surviving Band Members

**After the Massacre**:
Mike recorded that 37 men from Delshe's band survived—these were men who had survived other military actions before Skeleton Cave.

**Their Fate**:
> "37 men marched into Camp Verde in chains, 2 by 2"

**What This Tells Us**:
- Not all of Delshe's fighters were in the cave
- Some were out on raids or scattered elsewhere
- After their chief's death, they surrendered
- They were treated as prisoners—chained, marched in humiliation

**One Story**:
Mike mentions **Wepotehe's son**, whose father died (unclear when/where). After his father's death, the son "escaped to Jerome area"—showing that even after surrender, some Yavapai fled rather than accept reservation life.

## What Delshe Represents

### The Last Great Warrior

**Traditional Leadership**:
Delshe represented the old way—Yavapai warriors protecting their territory, living free, fighting to defend their people. He was successful "always victorious before" because he understood the old kind of warfare—raids, ambush, knowledge of terrain, guerrilla tactics.

**The New Reality**:
But December 28, 1872 showed the new reality:
- Overwhelming military force
- Scout betrayal (Apache, Pima, Maricopa scouts helping soldiers)
- New tactics (ricochet fire)
- Total war against civilians
- No refuge sacred enough to protect

Delshe's death marked the end of successful armed Yavapai resistance.

### The Failed Protector

**The Tragic Irony**:
- Delshe gathered ~225 people under his protection
- He chose the cave believing it impregnable
- He gave tactical orders to maximize defense
- He did everything right by traditional warrior logic
- All 225 died anyway

**Mike's Perspective**:
As a seven-year-old forced to watch, Mike saw his chief fail to protect them—not through cowardice or poor leadership, but because the world had changed. Traditional tactics and courage weren't enough against the Fifth Cavalry's ruthless efficiency.

### The Symbol

**For Yavapai People**:
Delshe's death symbolizes:
- The end of military resistance
- The impossibility of defending traditional life
- The overwhelming force of American expansion
- The death of the old ways

**For the Novel**:
Delshe can represent:
- The doomed nobility of resistance
- The tragedy of fighting an unwinnable war
- The death of a way of life
- The moment when courage and tactical skill weren't enough

---

## For the Novel: Delshe as Character

### The Challenge

**Limited Information**:
Mike's account gives us:
- Delshe was a great warrior
- His territory was Four Peaks/Superstitions
- He was always victorious before
- He chose Skeleton Cave as refuge
- He gave defensive orders
- He died there

We don't have:
- His age
- His appearance
- His personality beyond warrior status
- His relationships with other chiefs
- His family (were they in the cave?)
- His previous victories
- His speeches or philosophy

**Creative Opportunity**:
The novel can develop Delshe based on:
- Yavapai cultural norms for chiefs and warriors
- The tactical intelligence shown in choosing Skeleton Cave
- The confidence implied in "always victorious before"
- The responsibility of protecting ~225 people
- Seven-year-old Mike's perception of him

### Possible Scenes

1. **Before the Cave** (imagined):
Delshe making the decision to gather his people and flee to Skeleton Cave. His reasoning. His confidence. His preparations.

2. **Inside the Cave**:
Delshe organizing defenses. Positioning fighters. Reassuring families. Preparing for battle. "Get behind the big rocks—soldiers can't see you there."

3. **The Death Chant**:
Bourke's diary mentions a death chant began when defenders realized they would die. Did Delshe lead it? What did he sing? What were his final thoughts?

4. **Mike's View**:
How did seven-year-old Hoomothya see Chief Delshe? As protector? Great warrior? The man who would save them? And then—witnessing his failure, his death?

### Character Complexity

**Delshe Should Not Be**:
- Romanticized "noble savage"
- Simple victim with no agency
- One-dimensional warrior stereotype
- Merely symbolic rather than human

**Delshe Should Be**:
- Tactically intelligent leader making calculated decisions
- Confident based on real previous victories
- Responsible for ~225 lives—the weight of that
- Limited by not understanding the new kind of warfare
- Human—capable of error, pride, courage, fear
- Real enough that Mike would remember him as "great warrior"

### The Emotional Truth

**For Mike**:
Watching Delshe die meant:
- The death of his chief and protector
- The failure of Yavapai military resistance
- The impossibility of traditional life continuing
- The end of hope that they could win

**For Readers**:
Delshe's death should hurt. Not because he's symbolic, but because he was a man making the best decisions he could with the information he had, protecting his people as well as he knew how, and it wasn't enough.

---

## Thematic Significance

**The Impossibility of Resistance**:
Delshe did everything right and everyone died anyway. This is the brutal reality Mike witnessed—courage, tactical skill, and righteous cause weren't enough against overwhelming military power.

**The Death of the Old Ways**:
With Delshe died the possibility of continuing traditional Yavapai warrior life. After Skeleton Cave, surrender was inevitable.

**Witness and Memory**:
Mike remembered Delshe as "great warrior." This matters. Mike could have blamed Delshe for leading people to their deaths. Instead, he honored him. This tells us about Mike's understanding—Delshe wasn't responsible for the massacre. The soldiers were.

**Historical Truth**:
Mike's insistence that Delshe died at Skeleton Cave—contradicting military records—is crucial. It shows:
- Mike as reliable eyewitness
- Military records as incomplete/inaccurate
- The importance of Indigenous testimony
- The novel's commitment to Mike's truth over official narratives

## Research Gaps and Questions

**What We Know** (from Mike):
- Chief of Yavapai band
- Territory: Four Peaks, Superstition Mountains
- Great warrior, always victorious before
- At Skeleton Cave December 28, 1872
- Gave defensive orders
- Died in the massacre
- 37 men from his band survived and surrendered in chains

**What We Need**:
- Yavapai oral traditions about Delshe
- Whether Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation has records/memories of him
- Previous battles he fought and won
- His role in broader Yavapai resistance to American expansion
- Military records describing encounters with him before Skeleton Cave
- Whether name "Delshe/Delche/Delchay" has meaning in Yavapai

**Questions for Novel Development**:
- How old was he in 1872?
- Did he have family in the cave?
- What were his previous victories that made him confident?
- How did other Yavapai view him—beloved? Respected? Feared?
- What would he have wanted Mike to remember about him?

## A Final Note: The Man Who Couldn't Protect Them

Chief Delshe gathered approximately 225 people—men, women, children—and led them to a cave he believed was safe. He told them to get behind the rocks where soldiers couldn't see them. He was a great warrior who had always been victorious before.

And then the soldiers came, and everyone died.

Seven-year-old Hoomothya watched it all. He watched his chief fail to protect them. He watched his father die, his siblings die, his grandfather die, his aunt and her five children die. He watched approximately 225 people get "shattered so completely that they could not be recognized as humans."

And he remembered Delshe as a "great warrior."

Not a fool. Not a failure. Not the man who led them to death.

A great warrior who did his best in an impossible situation.

That generosity of memory—that refusal to blame Delshe for the massacre the soldiers committed—tells us everything we need to know about Mike Burns's character and about who was truly responsible for what happened at Skeleton Cave.
