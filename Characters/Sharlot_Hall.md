## The Mike Burns Connection: 1910

### The Letter

**Mike Burns contacted Sharlot Hall in 1910**, writing to introduce himself as:
> "I am an Apache Indian" seeking help publishing his work

**Context of the letter**:
- Mike was ~45 years old
- He had lived with his story for 38 years since Skeleton Cave
- He wanted his witness published, heard, preserved
- He reached out to the only historian he knew who might listen

**What Mike was asking**:
- Help publishing his autobiography
- Validation that his story mattered
- Someone to bear witness to his witness
- A chance to speak truth before he died

### Hall's Response: What We Know and Don't Know

**Historical Record is Unclear**:
- Hall received and preserved Mike's letter (now in museum archives)
- She kept his manuscripts after his death in 1934
- But did she help him during his lifetime? Try to find a publisher?
- No evidence of publication efforts before Mike's death

**The Silence**:
- Mike's manuscripts remained unpublished for 76+ years after his death
- Hall died in 1943, still unpublished
- Not published until 2010 (Sharlot Hall Museum Press) and 2012

**Possible explanations** (for novel development):
- Publishing climate hostile to Native perspectives
- Hall tried but couldn't find willing publisher
- Hall's own workload prevented her from helping
- Racism and indifference of the era
- Mike's story too painful, too accusatory

### The Preservation

**What Hall DID do** (crucial legacy):
- Kept Mike Burns's manuscripts safe
- Filed them in her museum archives
- Ensured they survived for future generations
- Made eventual publication possible

**Without Sharlot Hall**:
- Mike's manuscripts might have been lost, destroyed, forgotten
- His witness might have died with him
- We might never have known Hoomothya's story

## Character Development Notes for Novel

### The Woman Who Listened

**Hall's significance to Mike**:
- She represented hope—someone who might care about his story
- She was accessible (unlike Eastern publishers or academics)
- She was collecting Arizona history, including Native perspectives
- A woman in power (unusual) might understand marginalization

**The relationship's poignancy**:
- Mike trusted her with his life story
- She preserved it but couldn't (or didn't) publish it
- He died not knowing if anyone would ever read his words
- She kept faith with his witness even if she couldn't fulfill his hope

### Characterization Challenges

**Avoid hagiography**:
- Hall was progressive for her era, but still of her era
- She collected Native stories but from settler perspective
- Her preservation work was invaluable but not neutral
- Good intentions mixed with limitations

**The painful questions**:
- Did she try hard enough to publish Mike's story?
- Did she truly understand its importance?
- Was she complicit in the silence that lasted 76 years?
- Or was she the only one who tried at all?

**Show the complexity**:
- Gratitude for preservation + frustration at silence
- Recognition of her groundbreaking work + acknowledgment of its limits
- The woman who saved the story + the woman who didn't publish it

## Key Relationship Moments for Novel

### The Letter (January 6, 1910)

**Mike writing to Hall**:
- Vulnerability of asking for help
- Hope that someone will care
- Fear of rejection or indifference
- Courage to share his witness

**Possible scene elements**:
- Mike drafting the letter, crossing out words
- Explaining Skeleton Cave to someone who wasn't there
- Offering his story: will you help me?
- Waiting for a response

### Hall's Response (Unknown Historical Details = Fiction Opportunity)

**What happened next?**
- Did Hall write back? Meet with Mike?
- Did she read his manuscript? React to it?
- Did she try to help? Fail? Give up?
- What did she say to him?

**Dramatic possibilities**:
- Hall reading Mike's account of Skeleton Cave—what did she feel?
- Her attempts to find a publisher—doors closing, indifference
- Having to tell Mike: I can't help you (if that's what happened)
- Or: keeping hope alive while knowing it was unlikely

### After Mike's Death (1934)

**Hall as keeper of the flame**:
- Mike died November 26, 1934
- Hall lived until 1943
- She kept his manuscripts for 9 more years
- Did she try again to publish? Keep hoping?

**The silence**:
- What did Hall think, holding those manuscripts?
- Did she feel she'd failed Mike?
- Or did she trust future generations would listen?
- The weight of being the only one who kept his story safe

## Thematic Significance

Hall embodies:
- **Preservation vs. Publication**: Saving a story isn't the same as sharing it
- **Well-meaning allies**: Good intentions don't guarantee results
- **Historical gatekeeping**: Who decides which stories get told?
- **Generational witness**: Hall preserved for people she'd never meet
- **Incomplete justice**: Mike's story survived but he never saw it published

## For the Author: Handling Hall in the Novel

### Do:
- Show Mike's hope when writing to her
- Explore the painful gap between preservation and publication
- Let Hall be complicated—helpful AND limited
- Use her to examine who controls historical narratives
- Show gratitude for preservation without ignoring 76-year silence

### Don't:
- Make her a simple savior or villain
- Ignore the historical record's gaps
- Invent details without marking them as fiction
- Let her white perspective overshadow Mike's story
- Resolve the ambiguity too neatly

### Key Scenes to Consider:

**Mike's perspective**:
- Writing the 1910 letter—what did he hope for?
- Receiving response (or silence)—what did he feel?
- Waiting years for publication—did hope fade?
- Dying unpublished—what did he think in those final days?

**Hall's possible perspective** (if novel includes her POV):
- Reading Mike's manuscript—recognition of its importance
- Confronting publishing world's racism and indifference
- Deciding to preserve even if she couldn't publish
- Her own death (1943) with manuscripts still unpublished

**The flash-forward** (Epilogue possibility):
- 2010: Sharlot Hall Museum Press finally publishes
- 2012: University of Arizona Press edition
- Mike's voice finally heard, 76+ years late
- Hall's preservation made it possible

## Historical Questions for Research

- [ ] What exactly did Hall do with Mike's manuscripts 1910-1943?
- [ ] Are there letters between Hall and Mike in the archives?
- [ ] Did Hall write about Mike in her own papers/journals?
- [ ] Did she try to publish his work? Evidence?
- [ ] What did Hall's museum records say about the manuscripts?
- [ ] When did the museum decide to publish (2010)?

## The Ultimate Irony

**Sharlot Hall Museum Press** published Mike's story in 2010:
- 100 years after Mike's letter to Hall
- 76 years after Mike's death
- 67 years after Hall's death
- The institution Hall created finally fulfilled Mike's 1910 request
- Both Mike and Hall were gone, but the witness survived

**For the novel**: This irony should break readers' hearts. Mike's story was worth preserving, worth publishing, worth reading—but neither he nor the woman he trusted with it lived to see it happen.
