# Captain James Burns

**Rank**: Captain, Company G, 5th U.S. Cavalry
**Service Period**: 1872-1874
**Station**: Fort McDowell, Arizona Territory
**Nationality**: Irish
**Died**: 1874, Navajo Springs (after crossing Little Colorado River)
**Buried**: Fort Wingate, New Mexico
**Family**: Wife Annie, daughter Katie

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Mike Burns's testimony is the **PRIMARY and AUTHORITATIVE source** for Captain Burns's role and character. His first-person account provides intimate details unavailable in military records.

Captain James Burns embodies one of history's most profound and troubling contradictions: he was simultaneously the man who captured Mike Burns and led the massacre that killed Mike's family, and the adoptive father who treated Mike "as if I were his own child." Mike's account reveals a complex figure—an Irish officer caught between military duty and human compassion, whose brief relationship with Mike left indelible marks on both their lives.

## Military Service

**Unit**: Company G, 5th U.S. Cavalry
**Campaign**: General George Crook's Winter Campaign of 1872-1873 against Yavapai and Apache peoples
**Period of Service with Mike**: December 22, 1872 - 1874

The 5th Cavalry was highly active during this period, defeating Apache and Yavapai forces in 95 engagements from 1871 to 1874 in Arizona. General William Sherman told a committee from the United States House of Representatives that "the services of the 5th Cavalry Regiment in Arizona were unequaled by that of any Cavalry Regiment."

## Capture of Mike Burns (December 22, 1872)

**Setting**: Near Four Peaks Mountains, elevation ~7,645 feet. Heavy snow, bitter cold.

**The Child**: Seven-year-old Hoomothya, abandoned by his uncle when soldiers appeared. He hid in a rock hole all night wearing only a G-string, nearly froze to death. The next morning, December 22, 1872, the terrified boy emerged and was captured.

**Brought to Burns**: Lieutenant E.D. Thomas recorded the capture date and brought the boy to Captain James Burns.

**Mike's Account of First Meeting**:
The frightened child was dragged over rocks and bushes to Captain Burns at Fort McDowell. Mike was terrified, believing the soldiers were demons come to kill him. He did not understand English. He did not know these men would force him to witness the murder of his family six days later.

## The Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)

### Command Question: Mike Burns vs. Military Records

**Mike Burns states** (PRIMARY/AUTHORITATIVE): Captain James Burns commanded the operation

**Secondary sources state**: Captain William H. Brown led 130 troopers from 5th US Cavalry + 30 Apache scouts

**Resolution**: Both may have been present with different roles. Captain Burns (Mike's captor, G Troop) and Captain Price (F Troop) are mentioned together in Mike's account. **Mike's version is authoritative for his experience**—he knew who captured him and who forced him to witness the massacre.

### The Massacre

**Date**: December 28, 1872, six days after capturing Mike

**Location**: Cave on north side of Salt River at mouth of Fish Creek

**Victims**: Approximately 225 people according to Mike's eyewitness testimony (Army records claim 54-76)

**Mike's Family Killed**:
- Father
- Grandfather
- Little brother (whom Mike had cared for since mother's death)
- Baby sister (~3 years old, whom Mike had cared for)
- Aunt with her 5 children
- Uncle
- Brother-in-law (last to die)
- Chief Delshe

**Mike's Experience**: Forced to witness the massacre. The soldiers used ricochet fire—shooting volleys of lead behind big boulders so the cave walls scattered glancing bullets into the people beneath. "The showers of lead simply shattered the people so completely that they could not be recognized as humans."

## Adoption: The Moral Paradox

### Burns's Decision

When Captain Burns learned that the boy he had captured was now orphaned by the massacre—his entire family killed—he made the decision to adopt him.

**Why?** Mike's account suggests Burns felt genuine care for the child, though the motivations were complex:
- Responsibility or guilt for orphaning him
- Genuine affection that developed quickly
- Irish cultural values about family and orphans
- The military pattern of officers occasionally taking in Native children

**The Name**: Lieutenant E.D. Thomas named him "Mickie"—"Mickey would be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona!" The surname "Burns" came from Captain Burns himself when Mike became his ward.

### Character: Mike Burns's Portrait

Mike's testimony reveals Captain Burns as more complex than military records suggest:

**As Guardian (1872-1874)**:
> "He treated me as if I were his own child."

**Family Life**:
- Wife: Annie Burns
- Daughter: Katie Burns
- Home: Various military posts with Fifth Cavalry

**The Irish Promise**:
Burns told Mike he would take him to Ireland to meet his parents. This promise became one of the defining unfulfilled hopes of Mike's childhood.

**Burns's Last Words to Mike** (1874, before deploying):
> "My boy, you'll be all right. I'll return in a short time, and then we'll leave for Ireland, my father's home."

**Mike's Memory**: Burns was kind to him. Despite the impossible contradiction of their relationship—captor and father, destroyer and protector—Mike remembered Burns with what seems like genuine affection mixed with the complexity of understanding what Burns had done.

## Illness and Death (1874)

**Winter 1873**: Burns got sick while scouting, placed on sick list

**1874**: While crossing the Little Colorado River near Navajo Springs, Captain Burns died

**Burial**: Fort Wingate, New Mexico

**Impact on Mike**: At age 9-10, Mike lost his second father (first was killed at Skeleton Cave). The promise of Ireland died with Burns. Mike was given to Lieutenant/Captain Hall S. Bishop, beginning a new chapter of his adopted military life.

**Mike's Later Reflection**: When Captain John Gregory Bourke told Mike that Mrs. Annie Burns had died in Washington, Mike wrote to her parents as Bourke advised—maintaining connection to the Burns family even after the Captain's death.

## The Contradiction Burns Embodies

Captain James Burns represents the profound moral paradoxes of the Indian Wars:

**Destroyer and Protector**:
- Led (or participated in) massacre of Mike's family
- Adopted and loved the orphaned survivor

**Military Duty vs. Human Compassion**:
- Followed orders to pacify "hostile" Indians
- Showed individual kindness to a Yavapai child

**Cultural Obliteration vs. Personal Care**:
- Part of a system designed to erase Indigenous peoples
- Created a father-son bond across that divide

**The Unanswerable Question**:
How could Burns treat Mike "as if I were his own child" while bearing responsibility for making him an orphan? Mike lived with this contradiction his entire life—loving and being loved by the man whose military actions destroyed his family.

This is not a contradiction Mike could resolve. It's a contradiction he had to survive.

## Mike's Complex Relationship with Burns's Memory

Mike never explicitly condemned Captain Burns in his manuscript. This is striking given:
- Burns captured him
- Burns commanded (or participated in) the massacre
- Burns forced him to witness his family's murder

Instead, Mike remembered:
- Burns's kindness to him
- Burns's promise of Ireland
- Burns's treatment "as if I were his own child"
- Burns's death while Mike was still a child

**Possible Interpretations**:

1. **Survival Psychology**: Mike needed to believe his adoptive father cared for him. A child cannot survive believing he's unloved.

2. **Genuine Complexity**: Burns may truly have felt guilt, responsibility, and affection—human emotions coexisting with participation in atrocity.

3. **Mike's Wisdom**: By the time Mike wrote his manuscript (1910-1934), he understood that individual kindness and systemic violence can coexist in the same person. Condemning Burns wouldn't change what happened.

4. **Unspoken Truth**: Mike's decision to document Burns's kindness while also documenting the massacre speaks louder than explicit condemnation. He lets readers draw their own conclusions about the man who was both destroyer and father.

## For the Novel: Burns as Character

### Key Scenes to Develop

1. **First Meeting** (December 22, 1872): Terrified Yavapai child meets Irish captain. Neither speaks the other's language. Burns makes decision to keep the boy.

2. **Six Days Before the Massacre**: What happened between December 22-28? Did Burns know what was coming? Did he keep Mike close or distant? How did Burns justify what he was about to do?

3. **The Morning of the Massacre**: Burns preparing for battle. Mike sensing something terrible. The moment Mike realizes where they're going.

4. **After**: Burns seeing the boy's reaction to witnessing his family's death. The decision to adopt him becomes urgent—moral compensation impossible to achieve.

5. **Daily Life (1872-1874)**: Burns teaching Mike English. Annie and Katie Burns as family. The promise of Ireland. Moments of genuine affection amid impossible circumstances.

6. **Burns's Final Goodbye** (1874): "My boy, you'll be all right. I'll return in a short time, and then we'll leave for Ireland, my father's home." A promise he couldn't keep.

### Character Complexity

Burns cannot be one-dimensional. He must be:
- A competent military officer following orders
- An Irishman with cultural values about family, orphans, and care
- A man capable of participating in massacre
- A man capable of genuine love for a child
- Someone who made promises he believed
- Someone who died before fulfilling those promises
- A paradox Mike never fully resolved

### Emotional Truth

The novel must hold the contradiction without resolving it:
- Burns was kind to Mike AND led the massacre
- Mike loved Burns AND Burns destroyed his family
- Kindness doesn't erase atrocity
- Atrocity doesn't negate genuine human connection
- Both truths coexist, unbearably

This is the moral complexity at the heart of Mike's story. Burns is not a villain to be condemned or a hero to be praised. He's a man who did terrible things and kind things, and an eight-year-old boy had to make sense of that for the rest of his life.

## Historical Record vs. Mike's Account

**Military Records**: Sparse details about Burns personally. Focus on tactical operations, casualty counts, campaign success.

**Mike's Account**: Intimate portrait. Burns's family, his Irish heritage, his promises, his kindness, his death, his last words.

**Which is True?**: Both. Military records tell us what Burns did professionally. Mike tells us who Burns was personally—to the boy whose life he irreversibly changed.

**For the Novel**: Trust Mike. He lived with Burns. He knew Burns as a father. His testimony is authoritative not just on facts but on the emotional and moral complexity of their relationship.
