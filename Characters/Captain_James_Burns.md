# The Complicated Legacy of Captain James Burns

**Captain James Burns** was an officer in the 5th U.S. Cavalry during the Yavapai War in Arizona. While not a widely known historical figure, his actions in December 1872 had a profound and lasting impact on the life of a young Yavapai boy named Hoomothya, who would later be known as Mike Burns.

## Military Service and Career

**Service**: Captain, Company G, 5th U.S. Cavalry
**Station**: Fort McDowell, Arizona Territory
**Period**: 1872-1874 (died 1874)
**Campaign**: General George Crook's Winter Campaign of 1872-1873 against Yavapai and Apache peoples

The 5th Cavalry was highly active during this period, defeating Apache and Yavapai forces in 95 engagements from 1871 to 1874 in Arizona. General William Sherman told a committee from the United States House of Representatives that "the services of the 5th Cavalry Regiment in Arizona were unequaled by that of any Cavalry Regiment."

### December 1872 Operations

On December 27, 1872, Captain James Burns and several troops of the Fifth Cavalry were en route from Fort McDowell to the Salt River where a group of Mojave Apaches were reportedly in hiding. While crossing through the rugged Four Peaks Pass, Captain Burns made a surprise attack on a small Apache village, succeeding in killing six, while the rest fled through the canyons.

## The Skeleton Cave Massacre

### Capture of Hoomothya (December 22, 1872)

During his patrol operations, Captain Burns captured an eight-year-old Yavapai boy named Hoomothya on December 22, 1872—captured by a group of soldiers on patrol in the foothills along the Mazatzal Mountains three days before Christmas. The terrified child was taken to Captain James Burns at Fort McDowell.

### Role in the Massacre (December 28, 1872)

The captured child Hoomothya, frightened and uncertain of his fate, revealed to Captain Burns at their first meeting the whereabouts of a rancheria within a cave. The boy led the captain to a ridge and pointed out the location. Six days after his capture, Hoomothya was forced to lead the soldiers and Maricopa and Pima scouts to Skeleton Cave, where he witnessed the massacre of over 60 of his people, including his father and siblings, grandfather, uncle, and aunt.

The attack itself was led by Captain William H. Brown, but Captain Burns played a crucial role in the events leading to the massacre. Army records indicate 76 people were killed; Mike Burns himself later recalled that around 225 people were in the cave.

## A Contradictory Act: Adoption of Mike Burns

### The Adoption

When Captain Burns learned that Hoomothya had been orphaned by the massacre, he took the child in as a temporary ward and adopted him. Lieutenant Earl Thomas gave the boy the name "Mickey," saying there should be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona. The child ultimately became known as **Mike Burns** or "Apache Mickie."

### Motivations

The specific motivations behind Captain Burns's decision to adopt the boy are not explicitly documented in historical records. The available evidence suggests:

- He learned the boy was orphaned as a result of the slaughter of his extended family
- The adoption may have been influenced by a sense of responsibility or guilt
- It may have followed a pattern of military officers occasionally taking in Native children captured during campaigns (though this was not a widespread documented practice)
- Some officers took Native children as "pets" or companions, though Burns's relationship with Mike appears to have gone beyond this

The historical record characterizes it as taking in the child "as a temporary ward," though the relationship became a formal adoption.

### Brief Relationship

Captain James Burns died in 1874, only two years after adopting Mike Burns. After Burns's death, Mike was given to Captain Hall S. Bishop, indicating the boy remained in military custody rather than being returned to his people or sent to a reservation.

## Personality and Character Traits

The historical record provides limited information about Captain Burns's personality and character traits. What can be inferred:

**Military Competence**: As a company commander in the highly regarded 5th Cavalry during intense combat operations, Burns was likely an effective tactical officer.

**Moral Complexity**: Burns embodies one of the most profound contradictions in frontier military history—he was simultaneously:
- The captor who used a terrified eight-year-old child to locate his own people
- The adoptive father who took in that same child after orphaning him
- An agent of violent military policy against Indigenous peoples
- Someone who formed a bond strong enough to formally adopt a Yavapai child

**Historical Documentation**: Captain Burns documented the events at Skeleton Cave in his official reports. Lieutenant John Gregory Bourke also kept detailed diaries beginning in November 1872 that documented the massacre, though specific personality descriptions of Captain Burns from Bourke's writings have not been located in readily available sources.

## Legacy

The historical records of Captain James Burns is largely defined by his actions in December 1872. He is remembered not for his broader military career, but for the pivotal and paradoxical role he played in the life of Mike Burns.

His legacy is a complicated one—a mix of violence and an unexpected act that forever linked his name to the story of the Skeleton Cave Massacre and its survivor. He died just two years after these events, in 1874, leaving Mike Burns to be passed to another military officer and eventually sent to Carlisle Indian Industrial School.

Captain Burns represents the profound moral contradictions of the Indian Wars era: capable of both participating in violence against Indigenous peoples and showing individual acts of care toward a child victimized by that same violence.
