# Dr. Carlos Montezuma (Wassaja) (c. 1866-1923)

**Role in Mike Burns's Story**: Yavapai cousin who survived the Skeleton Cave Massacre as an infant; became first Native American male physician; reconnected with Mike and worked to establish Fort McDowell Reservation

## Historical Overview

**Birth Name**: Wassaja (meaning "Signaling" or "Beckoning" in Yavapai)
**Also Known As**: Carlos Montezuma (given by adoptive guardian)
**Life**: c. 1866 - January 31, 1923 (died age ~57)
**Tribe**: Yavapai (Kwevkepaya band)
**Relationship to Mike Burns**: Cousin (exact degree uncertain)
**Historical Significance**: First Native American male to earn medical degree; prominent Native American rights activist; co-founder of Society of American Indians

## Birth and Early Childhood (c. 1866-1871)

### Yavapai Roots
- Born near Four Peaks, Arizona Territory (same region as Mike Burns)
- Father: Cocuyevah (a Yavapai chief)
- Mother: Thilgeya
- Born into Kwevkepaya band during period of increasing conflict with U.S. military

### Survival of Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)

**The apcrp.md source states**:
> "One survivor who later went on to fame as a doctor and leader of the Yavapai people was a small Indian baby who was almost suffocated under the body of his dead mother. He was adopted by a Maricopa woman and later taken in by a wealthy easterner and educated. He is known by his assumed name, Dr. Carlos Montezuma, and was a cousin of Mike Burns."

**The massacre context**:
- Wassaja would have been approximately 5-6 years old at the time
- Found beneath his dead mother's body after the massacre
- Nearly suffocated before being discovered
- One of approximately 20-35 survivors out of 75+ Yavapai killed

**Immediate aftermath**:
- Initially taken in by a Maricopa woman (traditional enemy of the Yavapai)
- This likely saved his life from further violence
- Separated from surviving Yavapai family members

## Capture and Adoption (1871-1876)

### The Kidnapping (October 1871)

**Historical records indicate** (conflicting with massacre survival account):
- Some sources say he was kidnapped by Akimel O'odham (Pima) raiders in October 1871, before the massacre
- Age 5-6 years old at time of capture
- Taken from his Yavapai family during a raid

**[RESEARCH NOTE: Timeline discrepancy to resolve]**:
- The apcrp.md account (Skeleton Cave survivor) and Wikipedia account (kidnapped 1871, before massacre) conflict
- Need to verify which version is accurate through primary sources
- Both stories involve trauma, separation from family, survival against odds
- For novel purposes, consult historical experts on which account has better documentation

### Purchase by Carlo Gentile (c. 1871-1872)

**Carlo Gentile**:
- Italian photographer and showman
- Purchased the young Wassaja for $30 (30 silver dollars)
- Renamed him "Carlos Montezuma" (after himself and Montezuma II)
- Used the boy in Wild West shows, billed as "Azteka"

**Life with Gentile**:
- Traveled extensively across United States
- Performed in shows depicting "Indian life" for white audiences
- Exploited as exotic spectacle
- Experienced life as commodity, entertainment, curiosity

### Adoption by William H. Stedman (c. 1876)

**The rescue from exploitation**:
- Gentile fell on hard times, could not care for Carlos
- William H. Stedman, a Baptist minister from Chicago, took the boy in
- Stedman provided education, stability, genuine care
- Carlos took education seriously, excelled academically

## Education (1876-1889)

### Early Education in Illinois
- Largely self-educated in early years with Stedman's support
- Demonstrated exceptional intelligence and drive
- Faced racism but persisted in pursuing education

### University of Illinois (graduated 1884)

- Earned undergraduate degree
- Age ~18 at graduation
- Remarkable achievement for Native American in 1880s

- Earned medical degree at age ~23
- **Second Native American ever to earn medical degree** (after Susan La Flesche Picotte)
- **First Native American male physician** in United States
- Became fully licensed physician
- Revolutionary achievement for the era

**The significance**:
- In 1889, most Native Americans were confined to reservations
- Mike Burns was serving as Army scout during this period
- Carlos's education represented assimilationist "success story"
- Yet he would use this platform to fight for Native rights

## Medical Career (1889-1923)

### Bureau of Indian Affairs Service (8 years)

**Position**:
- Physician for Bureau of Indian Affairs
- Served at various Indian agencies and schools

**Growing disillusionment**:
- Witnessed terrible conditions on reservations
- Saw BIA corruption, incompetence, neglect
- Recognized reservation system as tool of oppression
- Began to question assimilationist policies
- Developed radical critique of entire Indian Affairs system

**The transformation**:
- Started career believing education/assimilation was answer
- Came to see BIA itself as problem
- Would become fierce critic of federal Indian policy

### Private Practice (1896-1923)

**Chicago medical practice**:
- Established successful practice in Chicago
- Treated both Native and non-Native patients
- Financial success allowed him to pursue activism
- Never forgot his Yavapai roots despite distance

## Reconnection with Yavapai Family (early 1900s)

### Finding His People

**The reunion**:
- In early 1900s, tracked down surviving Yavapai relatives
- Found cousin Mike Burns at Fort McDowell area
- Connected with Charles Dickens and his brother George (also Yavapai)
- Emotional return to people he'd been torn from as child

**Mike Burns as bridge**:
- Mike had remained connected to Yavapai community
- Mike could help Carlos learn language, customs he'd lost
- Both men survivors of trauma: Mike witnessed massacre, Carlos survived it
- Shared experience of living in white world while being Yavapai

### Correspondence Between Cousins

**Letter from Montezuma to Mike Burns** (documented in ASU PRISM archives):

**The fight for Yavapai land**:
- Carlos Montezuma was instrumental in creating Fort McDowell Reservation
- Worked alongside Mike Burns, Charles Dickens, and George Dickens
- Used his medical degree, connections, platform to advocate
- Helped secure permanent reservation for Yavapai people

**The irony**:
- Carlos fought for reservations while criticizing reservation system
- Recognized Yavapai needed land base to survive

## Character Development Notes for Novel

### Thematic Significance

**Montezuma represents**:

- Both served white institutions (Carlos BIA physician, Mike Army scout)
- Both rejected those institutions (Carlos quit BIA, Mike ambivalent about service)
- Carlos achieved "success" whites wanted; still fought them

- Different strategies, same goal: Yavapai survival

**What Carlos means to Mike**:

- Shared grief, shared survival
- Building relationship as adults

**Working together on Fort McDowell Reservation**:

**Carlos's death (1923)**:
- Mike losing his cousin
- Mike at the funeral, seeing Carlos buried
- Mike reflecting on different paths, same destination

### Characterization Notes

**Avoid**:
- Simple "success story" narrative

- Making him either pure assimilationist or pure traditionalist
- Erasing complexity of his politics
- Treating education as pure positive

**Show**:
- Brilliant, fierce, uncompromising
- Carrying trauma of Skeleton Cave throughout life
- Anger as fuel for activism
- Never fully at home in either world
- Love for Yavapai people despite distance
- Complexity: could work in white world while hating its treatment of Native peoples

**Voice and perspective**:
- Highly educated, articulate
- Medical/scientific training shows in thinking
- Passionate advocate in writing
- But what was he like in person with Yavapai family?
- Did he speak Yavapai? (Lost as child, might have relearned)
