# Mike Burns - Internal Conflicts and Character Evolution

**Purpose**: Map the psychological landscape, internal conflicts, and character transformation across Mike Burns's life to create authentic emotional depth in the novel.

---

## CORE INTERNAL CONFLICTS

### 1. IDENTITY: Hoomothya vs. Mike Burns

**The Central Split**

From December 28, 1872 (age 8) until his death, Mike lives with divided identity:

**Hoomothya** (Hidden Self):
- Yavapai child who survived
- Speaks/thinks in Yavapai (secretly)
- Remembers family, culture, traditional ways
- Carries grief, rage, survivor's guilt
- True self, but must be hidden to survive

**Mike Burns** (Performed Self):
- Name imposed by his family's killer
- English-speaking, educated, "civilized"
- Navigates white society, military service
- Outward compliance with assimilation
- Survival identity, but feels false

**The Conflict**:
- Can't be fully Hoomothya (would be punished, rejected, destroyed)
- Can't be only Mike Burns (would lose self, betray family, die inside)
- Must be both; can fully be neither
- "I live in two worlds, at home in neither"

**Evolution Across Life**:
- **Age 8-15**: Split begins, Hoomothya goes underground, Mike emerges as survival mask
- **Age 16-23**: Split deepens, code-switching becomes habitual, internal war intensifies
- **Age 24-43**: Seeking integration, questioning which self is "real"
- **Age 44-69**: Integration through witness - "I am both. I am Hoomothya AND Mike Burns."
- **Age 69 (death)**: Both identities claimed, both present, both honored

**For Novel**: This conflict drives internal monologue, creates constant tension, shows psychological cost of cultural genocide

---

### 2. MORAL CONFLICT: Survival vs. Betrayal

**The Impossible Choices**

Mike survives by making choices that feel like betrayal:

**Choice 1: Leading Soldiers to Cave (Dec 22-28, 1872)**
- Age 8, captive, terrified, coerced
- Knows where family is hiding
- Soldiers force him to lead them there
- Result: Entire family and band massacred
- **Conflict**: "Did I kill them? I was a child, a prisoner—but I led the soldiers. Did I have a choice? Does it matter?"
- **Haunts him**: Survivor's guilt compounded by feeling complicit
- **Evolution**: From childhood "it wasn't my fault" to adult "I know it wasn't, but I feel it was" to elder "I was powerless, but the guilt remains"

**Choice 2: Living with Captain Burns (1872-1874)**
- Accepting food, shelter, care from the man who orphaned him
- Feeling attachment, maybe even affection, for his captor
- Taking the name "Mike Burns"
- **Conflict**: "How can I be grateful to the man who destroyed my world? How can I feel anything but hate? But I do feel gratitude. What does that make me?"
- **Complexity**: Stockholm syndrome? Survival adaptation? Child's need for attachment? All of these?
- **Evolution**: From confused attachment to adult understanding of trauma bonding to elder recognition that both feelings (gratitude and rage) are valid

**Choice 3: Carlisle Assimilation (1880-1885)**
- Being a "good student" to avoid punishment
- Learning English fluently while losing Yavapai fluency?
- Cutting hair, wearing uniform, performing "civilization"
- **Conflict**: "Every day I become less Yavapai. To survive, I must cooperate with my own erasure. Does learning their language mean forgetting mine? Does wearing their clothes mean shedding my skin?"
- **Paradox**: Education gives him tools for eventual witness, but process nearly destroys what he's witnessing
- **Evolution**: From resistance → strategic compliance → using oppressor's tools (literacy) against oppressor (witness)

**Choice 4: Army Scout Service (1885-1888)**
- THE WORST MORAL COMPROMISE
- Serving the army that killed his family
- Tracking and hunting other Native peoples
- Using traditional Yavapai skills to harm other Indigenous people
- **Conflict**: "I am Yavapai tracking Apache. I am the hunted hunting the hunted. I wear the uniform of genocide. Every mission, I become more of what I hate."
- **Why he did it**: Employment? Survival? Nowhere else to go? Structure? All of these, none sufficient
- **The Weight**: Every tracked person mirrors his own family fleeing. When they see his brown skin in Army uniform, their eyes say: *traitor*
- **Evolution**: From compartmentalization (must not feel) → guilt accumulation → lifelong haunting → elder's attempt at understanding: "I did what I had to do to survive. It was still wrong. Both are true."

**For Novel**: These choices create moral complexity, prevent Mike from being simple victim or hero, show impossible nature of survival under genocide

---

### 3. BELONGING: Where Is Home?

**The Search for Place**

From age 8 onward, Mike never fully belongs anywhere:

**Not Fully Yavapai**:
- Raised by whites from age 8
- Educated at Carlisle, spoke English daily
- Served as Army scout (some Yavapai may view as betrayal)
- Lived outside community for decades
- **Question**: "Am I still Yavapai if I've lived white? Do my people claim me? Do I have the right to claim them?"

**Never Fully White**:
- Brown skin, Native features
- Always "Indian" in white eyes, no matter how educated
- Daily racism, social exclusion
- Citizenship denied repeatedly until 1908 (and even then, conditional)
- **Question**: "I speak their language, wear their clothes, served their army. But I'll never be one of them. So what am I?"

**Between Worlds**:
- "I live in two worlds, at home in neither"
- Can code-switch but never fully belong to either code
- Geographic displacement: Arizona → Pennsylvania → Kansas → military posts → Arizona
- Cultural displacement: Yavapai child → white-raised → Carlisle student → scout → returning Native
- **Question**: "Is there a place for someone like me? Or am I always exile?"

**Evolution**:
- **Age 8-23**: Forced displacement, no choice in belonging
- **Age 24-43**: Active search for belonging, attempting to reconnect with Yavapai community
- **Age 44-69**: Creating belonging through witness—if he can't belong geographically, he can belong through story
- **Age 69 (1934)**: Returns to Fort McDowell to die among Yavapai—partial homecoming, imperfect but real

**For Novel**: This conflict drives Mike's sense of loneliness, his searching, his eventual turn to writing as way to belong to his people through preserving their truth

---

### 4. WITNESS: Who Has the Right to Tell This Story?

**The Burden of Being "The Only One Living to Tell"**

**The Weight**:
- Everyone who knew him as Hoomothya is dead
- No one left who spoke his mother's name, his father's name
- No one to corroborate, validate, share the memory
- If he doesn't tell it, it dies with him
- **Conflict**: "I am the only witness. I must tell it perfectly, completely, truthfully. What if I forget something? What if I get it wrong? What if I fail them?"

**The Doubt**:
- "Who am I to speak for all who died?"
- "I survived—they didn't. Does survival make me worthy witness or guilty survivor?"
- "I've lived in white world so long. Can I still tell this story authentically?"
- **Imposter syndrome**: Maybe he's too assimilated, too changed, too distant

**The Responsibility**:
- Must write even when it's painful (reliving trauma with every word)
- Must write accurately (historical facts matter)
- Must write emotionally (truth isn't just facts, it's feeling)
- Must write for the dead (they can't speak; he must)
- Must write for the future (someone, someday, must know)

**The Rejection**:
- Writes for 24+ years (1910-1934)
- Seeks publication repeatedly
- Rejected repeatedly: "Not interested in Indian stories"
- **Crisis**: "If no one will publish it, does my witness matter? Should I keep writing anyway?"
- **Resolution**: "Yes. Truth survives even in silence. I write because they deserve witness, not because anyone's listening."

**Evolution**:
- **Age 43 (1908)**: Germination—"I must write this"
- **Age 45 (1910)**: Hope—writes to Sharlot Hall, seeks publication
- **Age 48 (1913)**: Determination—writes massacre scene despite pain
- **Age 50-65**: Persistence—continues despite rejections
- **Age 66-69 (1931-1934)**: Urgency—racing against death to finish
- **Age 69 (1934)**: Peace—dies with manuscript complete, published or not

**For Novel**: This conflict creates narrative tension (will he finish? will anyone listen?) and thematic depth (power of witness, who gets to tell history)

---

### 5. FORGIVENESS: Can He? Should He?

**The Unforgivable and the Human**

**Who to Forgive? For What?**

**Captain James Burns**:
- Killed his family, then raised him
- **Can Mike forgive?** The question is too simple
- **Real question**: "Can I hold rage and gratitude for the same person? Can I hate what he did and feel loss when he died?"
- **Mike's answer**: "I don't need to forgive or condemn. I need to tell the truth: it was complicated. Both things are real."

**The Army/Government**:
- Systematic genocide of his people
- **Can Mike forgive?** No
- **But**: Can he recognize individual humanity within evil system? Yes
- **Mike's position**: "I can see that some soldiers showed me kindness. That doesn't excuse the system. Individual humanity doesn't erase systemic evil."

**Himself**:
- For surviving when others didn't
- For leading soldiers to cave (even under coercion)
- For serving as Army scout
- For losing Yavapai language fluency? (if he did)
- For living in white world
- **Can Mike forgive himself?** This is the hardest question
- **Evolution**:
  - Age 8-30: "It's my fault. I should have died with them."
  - Age 30-50: "I did what I had to do to survive. But was it worth it?"
  - Age 50-69: "Survival isn't betrayal. I lived so I could tell. That's purpose enough."

**The Yavapai Community** (if they judged him):
- Did some Yavapai survivors view him as traitor (scout, white-raised)?
- **Mike's fear**: "Do my people claim me? Or am I outcast?"
- **Resolution** (unknown historically, fiction opportunity): Some acceptance, some judgment, some don't care—just like any community
- **Mike's peace**: "I am Yavapai whether they claim me or not. I know who I am."

**For Novel**: Forgiveness questions create moral complexity, prevent neat resolutions, honor the messiness of real trauma and survival

## CHARACTER EVOLUTION: SEVEN STAGES

### STAGE 1: Innocence (Birth - Dec 22, 1872) - Age 0-7

**Psychological State**: Secure, whole, belonging

**Core Traits**:
- Curious, playful, learning
- Loved and knows he's loved
- Culturally grounded in Yavapai ways
- Trusts the world (mostly)
- After mother's death: first awareness of danger, fear, loss

**Internal World**:
- Simple, immediate, sensory
- Present-focused
- Secure attachment to family
- No identity crisis—he's Hoomothya, Yavapai, son, child

**Key Psychological Need**: Safety, belonging, cultural learning

**What Ends This Stage**: December 22, 1872 - Capture

---

### STAGE 2: Trauma & Shock (Dec 22 - Late Dec 1872) - Age 8

**Psychological State**: Terror, dissociation, shattered world

**The Six Days** (Dec 22-28):
- Captive, forced to lead soldiers
- Knowing family's location, unable to warn them
- Anticipatory dread, helplessness
- **Peak trauma**: December 28, witnessing massacre

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Shock, numbness, possible dissociation
- Entire world destroyed in one morning
- Everyone he knew and loved: dead
- Only survivor, only witness

**Internal World**:
- Fragmented, overwhelmed
- Sensory overload or numbness (trauma response)
- Time distortion
- Possible selective amnesia for worst moments (brain protecting itself)

**Psychological Impact**:
- PTSD (though not diagnosed, clearly present)
- Survivor's guilt begins
- First split: Hoomothya (who he was) vs. what he must become to survive

**Key Psychological Need**: Safety, understanding what happened, grief process (won't get it)

**What Ends This Stage**: Adoption by Captain Burns - survival requires adaptation

---

### STAGE 3: Adaptation & Splitting (1873-1880) - Age 8-15

**Psychological State**: Survival mode, identity performance, hidden grief

**Core Adaptive Strategies**:
- **Dissociation**: Hoomothya goes underground, Mike Burns emerges
- **Hypervigilance**: Constantly reading Captain Burns, white society, staying safe
- **Emotional numbing**: Can't afford to feel grief fully (would be overwhelmed)
- **Compliance**: Performs assimilation to avoid punishment, gain approval
- **Secret resistance**: Whispers Yavapai, remembers family, keeps Hoomothya alive inside

**Relationship with Captain Burns**:
- **Attachment** (child's need for caregiver)
- **Fear** (captor, killer)
- **Gratitude** (provides care)
- **Rage** (killed family)
- All at once, all the time, no resolution (Burns dies 1874 when Mike is ~9)

**Internal World**:
- Two selves developing: Hoomothya (true) and Mike (performed)
- Constant code-switching
- Grief suppressed but present
- Trauma symptoms: nightmares, hypervigilance, startle response

**Key Psychological Need**: Attachment (even to captor), safety, making sense of impossible contradictions

**What Ends This Stage**: September 1880 - Sent to Carlisle

---

### STAGE 4: Institutionalization & Resistance (1880-1886) - Age 15-21

**Psychological State**: Strategic compliance, hidden defiance, identity crisis deepening

**Carlisle Years** (1880-1885):

**External Performance**:
- Model student (safer than rebel)
- Learns English fluently, trades, "civilization"
- Wears uniform, cuts hair, follows rules
- **Appears** to be successful assimilation

**Internal Reality**:
- Hoomothya still alive, speaking Yavapai in secret
- Rage at "Kill the Indian, save the man" philosophy
- Recognizing systematic oppression (education gives analytical tools)
- Solidarity with fellow students (shared resistance)
- **Growing consciousness**: "They're trying to erase me. I won't let them."

**Highland University** (1885-1886):
- One year, minimal documentation
- Different environment (less restrictive than Carlisle?)
- Why only one year? Unknown (fiction opportunity)

**Internal Conflict Intensifies**:
- "I'm learning their tools. Does that make me one of them?"
- "I speak English better than Yavapai now. Am I losing myself?"
- "They gave me literacy. I hate them for what they took. Both true."

**Key Psychological Need**: Intellectual stimulation (gets it), identity preservation (partial), peer solidarity (finds it)

**What Ends This Stage**: July 1885 - Enlists as Army scout (why? survival? employment? nowhere else to go?)

---

### STAGE 5: Moral Compromise & Compartmentalization (1885-1888) - Age 20-23

**Psychological State**: Moral crisis, emotional shutdown, guilt accumulation

**Two Scout Enlistments**:
- July-Dec 1885 (5-6 months)
- June 1887-Dec 1888 (18 months)
- **Total**: ~2 years of service

**The Impossible Position**:
- Tracking Native peoples for the army that killed his family
- Using Yavapai skills against other Indigenous people
- Seeing himself mirrored in those he hunts
- Witnessing their judgment: *traitor*

**Psychological Coping**:
- **Compartmentalization**: Separate feeling from action
- **Emotional numbing**: Can't afford to feel guilt fully (would be paralyzed)
- **Rationalization**: "I'm just doing my job. I need the pay. Where else can I go?"
- **But**: Rationalizations don't work. Guilt accumulates.

**Internal World**:
- Hoomothya ↔ Mike split at its worst
- Hoomothya screaming inside: "What are you doing?"
- Mike saying: "I'm surviving. What choice do I have?"
- Drinking? (Possible but undocumented)
- Nightmares, flashbacks, moral injury

**Key Trauma**:
- Each successful hunt re-traumatizes him
- Sees his family in those he tracks
- Sees himself in Army uniform and feels disgust
- **Question haunts him**: "What have I become?"

**Key Psychological Need**: To stop doing this (gets it - discharge Dec 1888), to process guilt (doesn't get it for decades)

**What Ends This Stage**: December 1888 - Discharge from Army

---

### STAGE 6: Searching & Germination (1889-1908) - Age 24-43

**Psychological State**: Seeking identity, place, purpose, meaning

**The "Lost Years"** - Sparsely Documented:

**External Life** (Unknown specifics):
- Return to Arizona
- Various employment (unknown)
- Attempting to reconnect with Yavapai community
- Citizenship attempts (rejected repeatedly)
- Social marginalization (neither white nor fully accepted as Yavapai?)

**Internal Evolution**:
- Processing accumulated trauma (finally has space to feel)
- Questioning everything: "Who am I? Where do I belong? What was it all for?"
- Guilt from scout service surfaces fully
- Grief for family finally processed (couldn't do it as child)
- **Beginning of witness consciousness**: "Someone needs to tell this story. I'm the only one left who can."

**Identity Integration Begins**:
- Hoomothya ↔ Mike starting to coexist rather than fight
- "Maybe I can be both. Maybe both are real."
- Reconnecting with Yavapai language, culture, community (where possible)
- Maintaining English, education, citizenship pursuit

**Key Turning Point** (July 15, 1908):
- First Native American registered to vote in Arizona Territory
- **Victory**: Recognition, citizenship, rights
- **Bitter irony**: Required "severing tribal relations" and proving "civilization"
- **Complexity**: "I'm American enough to vote. But voting for what? A government that killed my people?"

**Witness Consciousness Crystallizes**:
- By 1908, Mike knows: "I must write this down. This is my purpose. This is why I survived."

**Key Psychological Need**: Purpose (finds it in witness), belonging (partial), meaning-making (through story)

**What Ends This Stage**: January 6, 1910 - Letter to Sharlot Hall seeking publication help - witness mission begins

---

### STAGE 7: The Witness (1908-1934) - Age 43-69

**Psychological State**: Driven purpose, persistence, integration, peace-seeking

**The Writing Years** (1908/1910-1934):

**External Life**:
- Writing, revising, seeking publication
- Repeated rejections from publishers
- Continued work despite no audience
- May 28, 1934: Moves to Fort McDowell
- November 26, 1934: Dies (6 months after move)

**Internal Evolution - Identity Integration**:
- Hoomothya ↔ Mike no longer at war
- **Integrated self**: "I am Hoomothya. I am Mike Burns. Both are me. Both are real."
- Yavapai in his heart, English in his words
- Uses white education (literacy) to preserve Yavapai truth
- **Master's tools against master**

**Relationship with Trauma**:
- Must relive massacre to write it (1913 - 41 years after event)
- Writing is painful but necessary
- Trauma doesn't heal, but gains meaning through witness
- **Purpose from pain**: "I survived so I could tell."

**Persistence Despite Rejection**:
- 24 years of writing (1910-1934)
- Multiple publisher rejections
- "Not interested in Indian stories"
- **Crisis**: "Why write if no one will read?"
- **Resolution**: "I write for the dead. I write for truth. I write for whoever reads this in 100 years."

**Faith in Story's Survival**:
- Knows he may never see publication
- Trusts Sharlot Hall to preserve manuscript
- Believes truth outlives teller
- **Ultimate faith**: "My words will survive. Someone, someday, will listen."

**Final Integration** (Age 66-69):
- Returns to Fort McDowell (May 28, 1934)
- Dies among Yavapai people (Nov 26, 1934)
- Both Hoomothya and Mike Burns present at the end
- Manuscript complete (published or not, he fulfilled duty)
- **Peace**: Not perfect resolution, but witness accomplished

**Key Psychological Achievement**:
- Meaning from survival: "I am the only one living to tell. So I told."
- Identity integration: Both selves claimed, both honored
- Witness complete: Duty to dead fulfilled
- Faith in future: Story will survive

**What Ends This Stage**: Death, November 26, 1934

## KEY INTERNAL MONOLOGUE MOMENTS FOR NOVEL

1. **Age 8, post-massacre**: "Everyone is gone. Everyone. I am the only one left. Why me? Why not them?"

2. **Age 9, with Captain Burns**: "How can I feel safe with the man who killed them? But I do. What's wrong with me?"

3. **Age 16, Carlisle hair cutting**: "They're cutting away Hoomothya. Every snip, another piece of me falls. Can I survive this?"

4. **Age 21, first scout mission**: "I'm tracking Apache using Yavapai skills. My father would spit on me. My mother would weep. And I keep walking."

5. **Age 35, reconnecting with Yavapai**: "Do I still belong here? I speak their language but live in their world. What am I?"

6. **Age 45, deciding to write**: "If I don't tell it, no one will. It dies with me. So I must write, even if no one ever reads it."

7. **Age 48, writing massacre**: "I'm 48 years old and my hands are shaking. I can still hear the gunfire. I can still see their faces. I must write this anyway."

8. **Age 65, after another rejection**: "No one wants Indian stories. No one cares. But I'll keep writing. Truth doesn't need an audience to be true."

9. **Age 69, Fort McDowell**: "I'm home. Not the home I was born to—that's gone. But home among my people. It's enough."

10. **Age 69, final entry**: "I am Hoomothya. I am Mike Burns. I am the only one living to tell. And I have told. Now I can rest."

---

**This internal landscape—complex, contradictory, human—is what makes Mike Burns a character readers will never forget.**
