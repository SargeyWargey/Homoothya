## RELATIONSHIP PATTERNS & THEMATIC CLUSTERS

### Pattern 1: POWER & POWERLESSNESS

**Hoomothya** (Age 8):
- Captured by soldiers → Powerless
- Forced to lead them to cave → Powerless, complicit through coercion
- Watches family die → Powerless witness
- Taken by Captain Burns → Powerless dependent

**Mike Burns** (Young man):
- Carlisle student → Institutional powerlessness
- Must perform assimilation → Powerless over identity
- Army scout → Limited agency within hierarchy
- Navigates white society → Structural powerlessness

**Mike Burns** (Elder):
- Writes his story → Claims narrative power
- Seeks publication → Still dependent on gatekeepers (Sharlot Hall)
- Dies unpublished → Story powerless until 2010
- **BUT**: Story survives → Ultimate power of witness

### Pattern 2: SPLIT IDENTITIES & RELATIONSHIPS

**Hoomothya ↔ Mike Burns** (Internal relationship):
- Constant tension between selves
- Neither can be fully abandoned
- Language split: Yavapai thoughts in English words
- Cultural split: Yavapai worldview in American context
- The relationship with himself is central drama

**People who knew only Mike**:
- Carlisle teachers, white society, some Army colleagues
- Relate to performed identity, not full self
- Mike must hide Hoomothya to survive

**People who knew Hoomothya**:
- All dead except cousin Carlos Montezuma (maybe)
- No one left who remembers him as Yavapai child
- Must reconstruct Hoomothya alone in memory

### Pattern 3: DESTROYER/SAVIOR PARADOX

**Captain James Burns**:
- Destroyer (orphaned Mike) + Adoptive father
- Can't be purely hated or purely loved
- Dies before relationship can be understood
- Mike inherits his name, not his answers

**Richard Henry Pratt**:
- Cultural destroyer (assimilation system) + Educator (gave Mike literacy)
- Mike uses Carlisle skills to witness against genocide
- Hate the system, ambiguous about the man?

**General George Crook**:
- Ordered campaign that killed Mike's family + Some Apache respected him
- Later employed scouts including Mike
- Distant but omnipresent in Mike's life

### Pattern 4: WITNESS RELATIONSHIPS

**Mike ↔ His dead family**:
- They can't speak; he must speak for them
- Burden of being "the only one living to tell"
- Survivor's guilt: why him?
- Obligation to remember accurately

**Mike ↔ Sharlot Hall**:
- Mike trusts her with witness
- She preserves but doesn't publish
- Complicated legacy: saved story, but Mike died unheard

**Mike ↔ Future readers** (us):
- We read words he died without seeing published
- 76+ years late
- His witness finally heard
- But he never knew we'd listen

---

## RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THREE ACTS

### ACT I: BELONGING → ANNIHILATION
- Hoomothya has family, community, culture, identity
- Relationships are Yavapai-centered, culturally grounded
- December 1872: Every primary relationship violently severed
- Orphaned physically and culturally

### ACT II: FORCED RELATIONSHIPS → SURVIVAL PERFORMANCE
- Relationships imposed (Captain Burns, Pratt, Army)
- Mike must perform acceptable identity to survive
- Authentic connections rare, risky
- Hoomothya hidden in relationships built on Mike Burns performance

### ACT III: RECLAMATION → WITNESS
- Returns to Yavapai community (Fort McDowell)
- Reclaims Hoomothya while keeping Mike
- Writing becomes relationship with truth
- Final relationship: with us, the readers he never met

---

## DRAMATIC USES OF RELATIONSHIPS

### Conflict Sources

- Mike vs. military authorities
- Mike vs. internalized shame/trauma
- Mike vs. historical erasure (Sharlot Hall failure to publish)
- Hoomothya vs. Mike Burns (internal conflict)

### Emotional Anchors

- Captain Burns: unresolvable complexity
- Fellow students/scouts: survival strategies, solidarity
- Sharlot Hall: hope and disappointment

### Thematic Expressions
- Family relationships → cultural genocide's personal cost

## RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT

**Critical Cultural Consultation**:
- [ ] Yavapai naming practices for family members
- [ ] Appropriate representation of family relationships
- [ ] Cultural protocols for depicting deceased relatives
- [ ] Yavapai community perspectives on Mike's life choices

**Historical Research**:
- [ ] Did Mike Burns and Carlos Montezuma ever connect?
- [ ] Documented friendships from Carlisle years?
- [ ] Relationships with other Yavapai survivors?
- [ ] Letters/correspondence with anyone besides Sharlot Hall?
- [ ] Marriage? Children? (Not found in initial research)

**Fiction Opportunities** (gaps in record):
- Carlisle friendships and alliances
- Relationships during Army scout service
- Fort McDowell community connections (1934)
- Mike's internal relationship with Hoomothya

---

**[NOTE: All relationship characterizations must serve Mike Burns's journey and honor his witness. Cultural consultation required before finalizing any Yavapai family/community relationships. Fiction fills gaps but never contradicts documented evidence or cultural protocols.]**
