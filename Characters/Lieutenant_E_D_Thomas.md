# Lieutenant E.D. Thomas

**Rank**: Lieutenant (later Captain)
**Unit**: Fifth U.S. Cavalry, served under Captain James Burns
**Service Period with Mike**: 1872-1873 (direct), lifelong friend thereafter
**Role**: Named Mike "Mickie," recorded his capture date, lifelong friend

**PRIMARY SOURCE**: Mike Burns's manuscript provides the ONLY detailed account of Lieutenant Thomas's character and relationship with Mike. His testimony is authoritative.

Lieutenant E.D. Thomas was the man who gave Hoomothya his English name—"Mickie would be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona!" This seemingly lighthearted moment in December 1872 marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship between a cavalry officer and a Yavapai boy. Thomas documented Mike's capture date (December 22, 1872), witnessed the Skeleton Cave Massacre, and remained a friend to Mike across decades. He represents the possibility of genuine human connection amid systematic violence.

## The Naming (December 22, 1872)

### Mike's Capture Day

**Date**: December 22, 1872
**Location**: Near Four Peaks Mountains, Arizona Territory
**Circumstances**: Seven-year-old Hoomothya, abandoned by his uncle, spent the night in a rock hole during a snowstorm. The next morning, he emerged and was captured by soldiers.

**Thomas's Role**: Lieutenant E.D. Thomas was present at or immediately after the capture. He **recorded the capture date**—an official act that preserved this crucial historical detail.

### "At Least One Irish Indian in Arizona!"

**The Moment**:
When the terrified Yavapai boy was brought to Fort McDowell, Lieutenant Thomas looked at him and made a decision. The child needed a name Americans could pronounce and remember.

**Thomas's Words**:
> "Mickie would be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona!"

**The Name**: "Mickie" (later Mike) Burns
- "Mickie/Mike" given by Lieutenant Thomas
- "Burns" came from Captain James Burns when he adopted the boy

**Why "Irish"?**:
- Captain James Burns was Irish
- Thomas himself may have been Irish or Irish-American
- "Irish Indian" was likely a joke referencing Irish immigration and Native American presence—two groups marginalized in different ways
- The humor may seem strange given the circumstances, but it humanized the boy to the soldiers

**Mike's Response**:
Mike recorded this moment in his manuscript without apparent resentment. He became "Mike Burns" and kept that name his entire life. The name Thomas gave him became his identity in the white world.

## Relationship with Mike (1872-1873)

### At Fort McDowell (Late 1872)

After capture and naming, Mike was at Fort McDowell with Captain Burns and his unit. Lieutenant Thomas served under Burns, so he had regular contact with Mike during this period.

**What This Meant**:
- Thomas watched Mike adjust to captivity
- Witnessed his trauma after Skeleton Cave Massacre (December 28, 1872)
- Saw Mike's relationship with Captain Burns develop
- Part of the military community that became Mike's new world

### Camp Date Creek (1873)

**Spring 1873**: Mike lived with Lieutenant Thomas and his family at Camp Date Creek.

**Thomas's Family**:
- Wife: Mrs. Thomas
- Two children

**Mike's Role**: He herded chickens for Mrs. Thomas—domestic work common for children in frontier military families.

**Living Arrangement**: Mike lived with the Thomas family, experiencing family life with them. This gave him a model of white American family structure and domesticity.

**Duration**: Unclear how long, but this appears to be a temporary arrangement while Captain Burns was on other duties.

**Significance**: Thomas trusted Mike enough to bring him into his family home. Mrs. Thomas accepted Mike despite the circumstances. Mike experienced a kind of normalcy—children, chickens, domestic routines—amid the upheaval of his life.

## The Lifelong Friendship

### Mrs. Burns's Death

**Event**: Annie Burns (Captain James Burns's widow) died in Washington, D.C.

**Thomas's Role**: By this time, Thomas was on staff duty with General George Crook. He was the one who told Mike that Mrs. Burns had died.

**Thomas's Advice**: He advised Mike to write to Mrs. Burns's parents.

**What This Shows**:
- Thomas kept track of Mike across years
- He cared enough to inform Mike of significant news
- He guided Mike on appropriate responses (writing to her parents)
- He maintained connection to the Burns family history

**Mike's Response**: Mike followed Thomas's advice and wrote to Mrs. Burns's parents, maintaining connection to the family of his first adoptive father.

## The 1880 Reunion at Omaha

### The Meeting

**Date**: 1880
**Location**: Omaha, Nebraska
**Mike's Situation**: Age 15-16, traveling from Fort Laramie to Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania
**Thomas's Situation**: Now on staff duty, likely stationed at or near Fort Omaha (General Crook's headquarters for Department of the Platte)

**The Encounter**:
When Mike passed through Omaha on his way to Carlisle, he encountered Lieutenant (now possibly Captain) Thomas.

**Eight Years Later**:
They hadn't seen each other since 1873-1874. Mike was now a young man, educated by frontier soldiers, raised by Captain Bishop, heading to formal schooling. Thomas had been promoted, was on staff duty with Crook.

### The Gift and the Tears

**Thomas's Gift**: He gave Mike **$20 greenback**—significant money in 1880.

**Why Give Money?**:
- Ensure Mike had funds for journey
- Help with expenses at Carlisle
- Show he cared about Mike's welfare
- Mark significance of moment—Mike going to school, pursuing education

**The Goodbye**:
> "Shed tears at parting"

Both Thomas and Mike cried. For the second time in Mike's journey east (Lieutenant Bishop had cried at Cheyenne), a cavalry officer wept at parting from this Yavapai young man.

**What Made Them Cry?**:
- Eight years of separation, reunion, immediate goodbye again
- Thomas remembering the terrified seven-year-old he'd named
- Pride in what Mike had become
- Uncertainty about whether they'd meet again
- Genuine affection across the years and distance
- The weight of Mike's journey—from Skeleton Cave survivor to Carlisle student

## What Thomas Represents

### The Power of Naming

**Philosophical Weight**:
By naming Hoomothya "Mickie," Thomas performed an act of both violence and care:
- **Violence**: Replacing his Yavapai identity with an English name
- **Care**: Giving him a name that would help him survive in the white world

Mike lived his entire adult life as "Mike Burns"—the name Thomas gave him became his legal identity, his published author name, the name on his tombstone.

**The Question**: Did Thomas understand the weight of what he was doing? Or was it just a casual moment to him?

**For Mike**: That moment shaped his identity forever. Hoomothya became Mike. He carried both names, both identities, his whole life.

### Witness to Transformation

Thomas saw Mike at three crucial moments:
1. **December 1872**: Terrified captured child, just before massacre
2. **1873**: Traumatized orphan adjusting to life with Captain Burns
3. **1880**: Young man heading to education and unknown future

Each time, he witnessed Mike's transformation, survival, resilience.

### Continuity Across Change

**The Constant Friend**:
While guardians changed (Burns died, Bishop sent him away), Thomas remained a constant—sporadic but steady. He:
- Named him
- Housed him
- Informed him of important news
- Gave him money
- Cried at parting

This consistency mattered to a boy whose world kept shifting.

## For the Novel: Thomas as Character

### The Namer

**Key Scene to Develop**:
**December 22, 1872**: The moment of naming.

Setting: Fort McDowell. A terrified Yavapai child who doesn't speak English, recently dragged over rocks, nearly frozen to death, surrounded by the soldiers who represent death to his people.

Thomas looks at him and makes a joke: "Mickie would be at least one Irish Indian in Arizona!"

**What's happening beneath the surface?**:
- Is Thomas trying to humanize the boy to other soldiers?
- Make him seem less threatening, more familiar?
- Give him an identity that will help him survive?
- Or is it just casual humor, not understanding the weight?

**How does Mike experience it?**:
- Doesn't understand English yet
- Hears sounds that will become his new name
- Hears laughter—are they laughing at him? With him?
- Begins transformation from Hoomothya to Mickie

**The Novel's Challenge**: Show this moment's complexity—care and violence, humor and trauma, naming and erasure happening simultaneously.

### The Witness

**Thomas as Narrative Device**:
Thomas witnessed key moments across Mike's early life. He could serve as a perspective character for scenes where Mike's direct POV might be overwhelming.

**Example**: The aftermath of Skeleton Cave (December 28, 1872)—Thomas seeing Mike's reaction, understanding (or failing to understand) what the boy witnessed, watching Mike's trauma unfold.

### The Friend Across Time

**Three Meetings Structure**:
1. **1872-1873**: Child and officer, captor and named
2. **1880**: Young man and staff officer, student and supporter
3. **Possible third meeting?**: Unknown if they met again

**Emotional Arc**:
- First meeting: Power imbalance, trauma, naming
- Second meeting: Mutual affection, pride, tears
- Final status: Unknown—did they maintain contact? Meet again? Or did 1880 Omaha goodbye mark the end?

### Character Complexity

**Thomas Cannot Be**:
- Simple good guy who "saved" Mike with a kind name
- Villain who stole Mike's identity
- One-dimensional supporting character

**Thomas Must Be**:
- Genuinely fond of Mike AND part of system that destroyed his people
- Well-meaning AND complicit in cultural erasure
- Caring enough to cry AND not caring enough to question the system
- Complex enough to name a child with humor while that child's family lies dead in a cave

### The Unanswered Questions

**For the Novel to Explore**:
- Did Thomas ever feel guilt about Skeleton Cave?
- Did he understand what "Mickie" meant to Hoomothya—gift or theft?
- Why did he maintain connection across years?
- What did he think about the Army's Indian policy?
- Did he see Mike as friend? Ward? Curiosity?
- What did he feel when he heard Mike was writing his story?

**Don't Answer Everything**: Let some questions remain. Thomas's motivations can be as complex and contradictory as Mike's feelings about him.

## Thematic Significance

**Naming and Identity**:
Thomas gave Mike the name he would carry forever. This makes Thomas literally part of Mike's identity—whether Mike wanted it or not.

**The Possibility of Individual Kindness**:
Thomas showed genuine care for Mike across decades. But individual kindness didn't stop the massacre, didn't prevent the cultural erasure, didn't change the system.

**Witness and Record**:
Thomas **recorded Mike's capture date**—an official act that preserved historical truth. He witnessed Mike's transformation. In some ways, he documented Mike's story before Mike could write it himself.

**Continuity Amid Loss**:
Mike lost his Yavapai family, lost Captain Burns, was separated from Bishop. But Thomas remained—sporadic, but present. Sometimes the people who remain aren't the ones we'd choose, but they matter anyway.

## Research Gaps

**What We Know** (from Mike):
- Lieutenant in 1872, later promoted
- Served under Captain James Burns
- Named Mike "Mickie" December 22, 1872
- Recorded Mike's capture date
- Mike lived with Thomas family at Date Creek 1873
- Later served on General Crook's staff
- Told Mike about Mrs. Burns's death
- Met Mike at Omaha 1880, gave him $20, cried at parting
- Married with two children (as of 1873)

**What We Need**:
- Thomas's full name (E.D. = what?)
- Complete military service record
- Background before Arizona service
- Whether he wrote about Mike in letters/diary
- What happened to him after 1880
- Whether he and Mike maintained correspondence
- His own account of Skeleton Cave Massacre (if any exists)
- Whether he ever read Mike's manuscript

**Questions for Novel**:
- Did Thomas volunteer to name Mike or was he assigned?
- What did he think watching Mike go through trauma after massacre?
- Did his family (wife, children) grow attached to Mike?
- Did he advocate for Mike's education/future?
- Did he have guilt about the system he served?
- How did he justify participating in campaigns against Native peoples while caring for Native child?

## A Final Note: The Weight of a Name

Lieutenant E.D. Thomas gave Hoomothya a name: "Mickie."

That seven-year-old boy became Mike Burns—soldier, scout, student, husband, father, woodcutter, rancher, writer. He lived 62 years after Thomas named him. He signed his manuscript "Mike Burns." He died as Mike Burns. He's buried as Mike Burns.

Thomas probably never imagined the weight of that moment. Maybe he thought it was just a name, just a joke about Irish Indians. But names matter. Identity matters.

Hoomothya ("Wet Nose") became Mike Burns, and in that transformation—violent and kind, necessary and tragic—lies one of the core truths of Mike's story: he lived between two names, two worlds, two identities, his whole life.

Thomas didn't intend to create that burden. But he did. And Mike carried it—along with everything else—until the day he died.
